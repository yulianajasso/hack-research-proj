Case Files Internal Medicine,4,"DEDICATION
To the McGovern Medical School class of 2020,
who have continued to challenge and inspire me to be the
very best teacher possible. You are the first class of our new curriculum,
and you trusted that the theoretical dreams
and abstract fancies weaving the basic and clinical sciences with the art
of medicine in the Doctoring Courses would work. Four years later,
we know it worked, primarily because each of you believed
and worked diligently to fill in the gaps that we missed.
You are each what is most special about medicine and are the reason I teach.
May you have a wonderfully fulfilling and
rewarding career, and continue to learn and heal.

To my beloved wife, Cynthia, and my children, Lucas, Tomas, and
Carola, whose support, love, and understanding fill me
with hope, with energy, and with passion. To Dr. Herbert L. Fred,
a mentor and a friend. He may not be around,
but his light will shine forever.

Case Files Internal Medicine,18,"PREFACE
I have been deeply amazed and grateful to see how the Case Files® books have
been so well received and have helped students to learn more effectively. In the 16
short years since Case Files® Internal Medicine was first printed, the series has now
multiplied to span most of the clinical and the basic science disciplines and has
been translated into over a dozen foreign languages. Numerous students have sent
encouraging remarks, suggestions, and recommendations. Six completely new cases
have been written. The cases have retained the organ system organization for bet-
ter ability to integrate knowledge. Case correlation references are also used in this
edition. This sixth edition has been a collaborative work with my wonderful coau-
thors and contributors and with the suggestions from six generations of students.
We utilized focus groups of students to create a more user-friendly format for the
digital platform, such as bullet points for the case summary for faster reading and
more plentiful use of subheadings throughout the text. We have used entrustable
professional activities (EPA) corresponding to the learning objectives. The multiple-
choice questions (MCQs) have been carefully reviewed and rewritten to ensure
that they comply with the National Board and the US Medical Licensing Examina-
tion format. Truly, the enthusiastic encouragement from students throughout not
only the United States but also the world provides me the inspiration and energy to
continue to write. It is thus with humility that I offer my sincere thanks to students
everywhere … for without students, how can a teacher teach?

The curriculum that evolved into the ideas for this series was inspired by
Philbert Yau and Chuck Rosipal, two talented and forthright students, who have
since graduated from medical school. It has been a tremendous joy to work with my
excellent coauthor, Dr. Gabriel Aisenberg, who exemplifies the qualities of the ideal
physician—caring, empathetic, and avid teacher, and who is intellectually unparal-
leled. He had “big shoes” to fill in taking over from my dear friend and colleague
Dr. John Patlan, who has retired from academics and is currently in private practice.
We owe John a great debt for setting such a “high bar” with five excellent editions
of this book. Dr. Aisenberg would like to acknowledge Dr. Herbert Fred, a master
educator, teacher of the value of hard work and skepticism. Dr. Aisenberg and
I would like to express appreciation to Julia Chernis, who helped to coordinate
the assignment of cases and served as our student representative, including a thor-
ough student review for each case and careful reading of content, readability,
and questions/explanations. Julia is a special person and will succeed wherever she
goes. Julia would like to acknowledge Michael Kuhlmeier for his never-ending love
and support, as well as her amazing grandmother, Dr. Nadya Natanzon, whose
stories of her pediatric practice inspired her to pursue a career in medicine.
I am greatly indebted to Bob Boehringer, whose experience and vision helped to
support this series. I appreciate McGraw Hill’s believing in the concept of teach-
ing through clinical cases. I am also grateful to Catherine Saggese for her excel-
lent production expertise, and Madison Tucky for her wonderful and meticulous
role as editorial assistant. I cherish the ever-organized and precise project manager,
Sarika Gupta. It has been a privilege and honor to work with one of the brightest
medical students I have encountered, Joy Davis, who directed the review questions
and answers and gave input on the explanations for all the comprehension ques-
tions. As always, my daughter Allison serves as the assistant editor for the Case
Files Collection and has been meticulous and insightful concerning her review and
editing of this manuscript; she is like the key enzyme of the case files chemical
reactions, without whom all meaningful activity ceases and with whom the words
and concepts leap off the page with vigor and life. Most of all, I appreciate my
ever-loving wife, Terri, and our four wonderful children, Andy and his wife Anna,
Michael and his wife Nadine, Allison, and Christina and her husband Andy, for
their patience and understanding.

Case Files Internal Medicine,22,"INTRODUCTION
Mastering the cognitive knowledge within a field such as internal medicine is a
formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, procure and
filter through the clinical and laboratory data, develop a differential diagnosis, and,
finally, make a rational treatment plan. To gain these skills, the student learns best
at the bedside, guided and instructed by experienced teachers, and inspired toward
self-directed, diligent reading. Clearly, there is no replacement for education at the
bedside. Unfortunately, clinical situations usually do not encompass the breadth of
the specialty. Perhaps the best alternative is a carefully crafted patient case designed
to stimulate the clinical approach and the decision-making process. In an attempt
to achieve that goal, we have constructed a collection of clinical vignettes to teach
diagnostic or therapeutic approaches relevant to internal medicine.
Most importantly, the explanations for the cases emphasize the mechanisms
and underlying principles, rather than merely rote questions and answers. This
book is organized for versatility: It allows the student “in a rush” to go quickly
through the scenarios and check the corresponding answers, and it allows the
student who wants thought-provoking explanations to obtain them. The answers
are arranged from simple to complex: the bare answers, an analysis of the case, an
approach to the pertinent topic, a comprehension test at the end, clinical pearls
for emphasis, and a list of references for further reading. The clinical vignettes are
organized by system to help students compare and contrast, and integrate infor-
mation. A listing of cases is included later in this section to aid the student who
desires to test his or her knowledge of a certain area, or to review a topic, including
basic definitions. Finally, we intentionally did not use a multiple-choice question
format in the case scenarios because clues (or distractions) are not available in the
real world.
HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS BOOK
Each case is designed to simulate a patient encounter with open-ended questions.
At times, the patient’s complaint is different from the most concerning issue, and
sometimes extraneous information is given. The answers are organized into four
different parts, discussed next.
CLINICAL CASE FORMAT: PART I
1. Summary: The salient aspects of the case are identified, filtering out the extra-
neous information. Students should formulate their summary from the case
before looking at the answers. A comparison to the summation in the answer
will help to improve their ability to focus on the important data, while appro-
priately discarding the irrelevant information—a fundamental skill in clinical
problem-solving.
2. A straightforward Answer is given to each open-ended question.

and management
EPA 11 Obtain informed consent for tests and/or procedures
EPA 12 Perform general procedures as a physician
EPA 13 Identify system failures and contribute to a culture of safety and improvement
3. The Analysis of the case comprises two parts:
a. Objectives of the Case: A listing of the two or three main principles that
are crucial for a practitioner to manage the patient. Again, the students are
challenged to make educated “guesses” about the objectives of the case upon
initial review of the case scenario, which helps to sharpen their clinical and
analytical skills. We have included the entrustable professional activities
(EPA) corresponding to the objective for instructors and curriculum over-
seers (see Table 1).
b. Considerations: A discussion of the relevant points and brief approach to
the specific patient.
PART II
Approach to the Disease Process: It consists of two distinct parts:
a. Definitions: Terminology pertinent to the disease process.
b. Clinical Approach: A discussion of the approach to the clinical problem in
general, including tables, figures, and algorithms.
PART III
Comprehension Questions: Each case contains several multiple-choice questions,
which reinforce the material or which introduce new and related concepts. Ques-
tions about material not found in the text will have explanations in the answers.
PART IV
Clinical Pearls: Several clinically important points are reiterated as a summation of
the text. This allows for easy review, such as before an examination.

Part 1. Approach to the Patient
The transition from the textbook or journal article to the clinical situation is one of
the most challenging tasks in medicine. Retention of information is difficult; orga-
nization of the facts and recall of myriad data in precise application to the patient
are crucial. The purpose of this text is to facilitate in this process. The first step is
gathering information, also known as establishing the database. This includes tak-
ing the history (asking questions), performing the physical examination, and
obtaining selective laboratory and/or imaging tests. Of these, the historical exami-
nation is the most important and useful. Sensitivity and respect should always be
exercised during the interview of patients.
CLINICAL PEARL
The history is the single most important tool in obtaining a diagnosis. All
»
physical findings and laboratory and imaging studies are first obtained
and then interpreted in the light of the pertinent history.
HISTORY
1. Basic information: Age, gender, and ethnicity must be recorded because some
conditions are more common at certain ages; for instance, pain on defecation
and rectal bleeding in a 20-year-old may indicate inflammatory bowel disease,
whereas the same symptoms in a 60-year-old would more likely suggest colon
cancer.
2. Chief complaint: What is it that brought the patient into the hospital or clinic?
Is it a scheduled appointment or an unexpected symptom? The patient’s own
words should be used if possible, such as, “I feel like a ton of bricks are on my
chest.” The chief complaint, or reason for seeking medical attention, may not
be the first subject the patient talks about (in fact, it may be the last thing),
particularly if the subject is embarrassing, such as a sexually transmitted dis-
ease, or highly emotional, such as depression. It is often useful to clarify exactly
what the patient’s concern is; for example, the patient may fear the headaches
represent an underlying brain tumor.
3. History of present illness: This is the most crucial part of the entire database.
The questions one asks are guided by the differential diagnosis one begins to
consider the moment the patient identifies the chief complaint, as well as the
clinician’s knowledge of typical disease patterns and their natural history. The
duration and character of the primary complaint, associated symptoms, and
exacerbating/relieving factors should be recorded. Sometimes, the history
will be convoluted and lengthy, with multiple diagnostic or therapeutic inter-
ventions at different locations. For patients with chronic illnesses, obtaining
prior medical records is invaluable. For example, when extensive evaluation of
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 3 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,31,"4 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
a complicated medical problem has been done elsewhere, it is usually better
to first obtain those results than to repeat a “million-dollar workup.” When
reviewing prior records, it is often useful to review the primary data (eg, biopsy
reports, echocardiograms, serologic evaluations) rather than to rely upon a
diagnostic label applied by someone else, which then gets replicated in medical
records and, by repetition, acquires the aura of truth, when it may not be fully
supported by data. Some patients will be poor historians because of dementia,
confusion, or language barriers; recognition of these situations and querying
of family members are useful. When little or no history is available to guide a
focused investigation, more extensive objective studies are often necessary to
exclude potentially serious diagnoses.
4. Past history:
a. Illness: Any illnesses such as hypertension, hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, cancer,
heart disease, pulmonary disease, and thyroid disease should be elicited. If
an existing or prior diagnosis is not obvious, it is useful to ask exactly how
it was diagnosed, that is, what investigations were performed. Duration,
severity, and therapies should be queried.
b. Hospitalization: Any hospitalizations and emergency room visits should be
listed with the reason(s) for admission, the intervention, and the location
of the hospital.
c. Blood transfusion: Transfusions with any blood products should be listed,
including any adverse reactions.
d. Surgeries: The year and type of surgery should be elucidated and any com-
plications documented. The type of incision and any untoward effects of
the anesthesia or the surgery should be noted.
5. Allergies: Reactions to medications should be recorded, including severity and
temporal relationship to the medication. An adverse effect (eg, nausea) should
be differentiated from a true allergic reaction.
6. Medications: Current and previous medications should be listed, including
dosage, route, frequency, and duration of use. Prescription, over-the-counter,
and herbal medications are all relevant. Patients often forget their complete
medication list; thus, asking each patient to bring in all their medications—
both prescribed and nonprescribed—allows for a complete inventory.
7. Family history: Many conditions are inherited or are predisposed in family
members. The age and health of siblings, parents, grandparents, and others can
provide diagnostic clues. For instance, an individual with first-degree family
members with early-onset coronary heart disease is at risk for cardiovascular
disease.
8. Social history: This is one of the most important parts of the history in that
the patient’s functional status at home, social and economic circumstances, and
goals and aspirations for the future are often the critical determinant in what
the best way to manage a patient’s medical problem is. Living arrangements,
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 4 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,32,"SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS 5
economic situations, and religious affiliations may provide important clues
for puzzling diagnostic cases or suggest the acceptability of various diagnostic
or therapeutic options. Marital status and habits such as alcohol, tobacco, or
illicit drug use may be relevant as risk factors for disease. More specifically in
the domain of infectious diseases, understanding how many people the patient
cohabitates with, whether those people are known to be sick, the presence of
pets at home, and the recent travel history are noteworthy.
9. Review of systems: A few questions about each major body system ensure that
problems will not be overlooked. The clinician should avoid the mechanical
“rapid-fire” questioning technique that discourages patients from answering
truthfully because of fear of “annoying the doctor.”
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The physical examination begins as one is taking the history, by observing the
patient and beginning to consider a differential diagnosis. When performing the
physical examination, one focuses on body systems suggested by the differential
diagnosis and performs tests or maneuvers with specific questions in mind; for
example, does the patient with jaundice have ascites? When the physical exami-
nation is performed with potential diagnoses and expected physical findings in
mind (“one sees what one looks for”), the utility of the examination in adding to
diagnostic yield is greatly increased, as opposed to an unfocused “head-to-toe”
physical examination.
1. General appearance: A great deal of information is gathered by observation, as
one notes the patient’s body habitus, state of grooming, nutritional status, level
of anxiety (or perhaps inappropriate indifference), degree of pain or comfort,
mental status, speech patterns, and use of language. This forms your impres-
sion of “who this patient is.”
2. Vital signs: Vital signs like temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory
rate, height, and weight are often placed here. Blood pressure can sometimes
be different in the two arms; initially, it should be measured in both arms.
In patients with suspected hypovolemia, pulse and blood pressure should be
taken in lying and standing positions to look for orthostatic hypotension. It is
quite useful to take the vital signs oneself, rather than relying upon numbers
gathered by ancillary personnel using automated equipment, because impor-
tant decisions regarding patient care are often made using the vital signs as an
important determining factor.
3. Head and neck examination: Facial or periorbital edema and pupillary responses
should be noted. Fundoscopic examination provides a way to visualize the
effects of diseases such as diabetes on the microvasculature; papilledema can
signify increased intracranial pressure. Estimation of jugular venous pressure
is very useful to estimate volume status. The thyroid should be palpated for a
goiter or nodule and carotid arteries auscultated for bruits. Cervical (common)
and supraclavicular (pathologic) nodes should be palpated.
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 5 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,33,"6 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
4. Breast examination: Inspect for symmetry and for skin or nipple retraction
with the patient’s hands on her hips (to accentuate the pectoral muscles) and
also with arms raised. With the patient sitting and supine, the breasts should
then be palpated systematically to assess for masses. The nipple should be
assessed for discharge, and the axillary and supraclavicular regions should be
examined for adenopathy.
5. Cardiac examination: The point of maximal impulse should be ascertained for
size and location, and the heart should be auscultated at the apex and at the
base. Heart sounds, murmurs, and clicks should be characterized. Murmurs
should be classified according to intensity, duration, timing in the cardiac cycle,
and changes with various maneuvers. Systolic murmurs are very common and
often physiologic; diastolic murmurs are uncommon and usually pathologic.
The patient’s body habitus and the environmental noise limit the quality of
the heart auscultation; always search for a quiet place to examine the patient’s
heart.
6. Pulmonary examination: The lung fields should be examined systematically
and thoroughly. Wheezes, rales, rhonchi, and bronchial breath sounds should
be recorded. Percussion of the lung fields may be helpful in identifying the
hyperresonance of tension pneumothorax or the dullness of consolidated
pneumonia or a pleural effusion.
7. Abdominal examination: The abdomen should be inspected for scars, disten-
sion, or discoloration (eg, the Grey Turner sign of discoloration at the flank
areas indicating intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage). Ausculta-
tion of bowel sounds can identify normal versus high pitched and hyperactive
versus hypoactive. Percussion of the abdomen can be utilized to assess the size
of the liver and spleen and to detect ascites by noting shifting dullness. Care-
ful palpation should begin initially away from the area of pain, involving one
hand on top of the other, to assess for masses, tenderness, and peritoneal signs.
Tenderness should be recorded on a scale (eg, 1–4 where 4 is the most severe
pain). Guarding, and whether it is voluntary or involuntary, should be noted.
8. Back and spine examination: The back should be assessed for symmetry, ten-
derness, and masses. The flank regions are particularly important to assess for
pain on percussion, which might indicate renal disease.
9. Genitalia:
a. Females: The pelvic examination should include an inspection of the
external genitalia and, with the speculum, evaluation of the vagina and
cervix. A Papanicolaou test (Pap smear) and/or cervical cultures may be
obtained. A bimanual examination to assess the size, shape, and tenderness
of the uterus and adnexa is important.
b. Males: An inspection of the penis and testes is performed. Evaluation for
masses, tenderness, and lesions is important. Palpation for hernias in the
inguinal region with the patient standing and coughing to increase intra-
abdominal pressure is useful.
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 6 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,34,"SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS 7
10. Rectal examination: A digital rectal examination is generally performed for
those individuals with possible colorectal disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.
Masses should be assessed, and stool for occult blood should be tested. In men,
the prostate gland can be assessed for enlargement and for nodules.
11. Extremities: An examination for joint effusions, tenderness, edema, and cya-
nosis may be helpful. Clubbing of the nails might indicate pulmonary diseases
such as lung cancer or chronic cyanotic heart disease.
12. Neurologic examination: Patients who present with neurologic complaints
usually require a thorough assessment, including mental status, cranial nerves,
motor strength, sensation, and reflexes.
13. Skin examination: The skin should be carefully examined for evidence of
pigmented lesions (melanoma), cyanosis, or rashes that may indicate systemic
disease (malar rash of systemic lupus erythematosus).
LABORATORY AND IMAGING ASSESSMENT
1. Laboratory:
a. Complete blood count (CBC): The CBC is used to assess for anemia and
thrombocytopenia.
b. Serum chemistry: A chemistry panel is most commonly used to evaluate
renal and liver function, as well as glucose levels.
c. Hemoglobin A : this fraction of the total hemoglobin represents the addi-
1c
tion of glucose residues, which is proportional to the serum glucose levels,
but more stable than they are, thus providing with a more thorough assess-
ment of the control of diabetes mellitus.
d. Lipid panel: The lipid panel is particularly relevant in cardiovascular diseases.
e. Urinalysis: Urinalysis is often referred to as a “liquid renal biopsy” because
the presence of cells, casts, protein, or bacteria provides clues about under-
lying glomerular or tubular diseases.
f. Infection: Gram stain and culture of urine, sputum, and cerebrospinal fluid,
as well as blood cultures, are frequently useful to isolate the cause of infection.
2. Imaging procedures:
a. Chest radiography: Chest radiography is extremely useful in assessing car-
diac size and contour, chamber enlargement, pulmonary vasculature and
infiltrates, and the presence of pleural effusions.
b. Ultrasonographic examination: Ultrasonographic examination is useful for
identifying fluid-solid interfaces and for characterizing masses as cystic,
solid, or complex. It is also very helpful in evaluating the biliary tree,
kidney size, and evidence of ureteral obstruction and can be combined
with Doppler flow to identify deep venous thrombosis. Ultrasonography
is noninvasive and has no radiation risk, but it cannot be used to penetrate
through bone or air and is less useful in obese patients.
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 7 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,35,"8 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
CLINICAL PEARL
Ultrasonography is helpful in evaluating the biliary tree, looking for
»
ureteral obstruction, and evaluating vascular structures, but it has
limited utility in obese patients.
c. Computed tomography: Computed tomography (CT) is helpful in possible
intracranial bleeding, abdominal and/or pelvic masses, and pulmonary pro-
cesses and may help to delineate the lymph nodes and retroperitoneal dis-
orders. CT exposes the patient to radiation and requires the patient to be
immobilized during the procedure. Generally, CT requires administration
of a radiocontrast dye, which can be nephrotoxic.
d. Magnetic resonance imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identi-
fies soft-tissue planes very well and provides the best imaging of the brain
parenchyma. When used with gadolinium contrast (which is not nephro-
toxic), MR angiography (MRA) is useful for delineating vascular structures.
MRI does not use radiation, but the powerful magnetic field prohibits its
use in patients with ferromagnetic metal in their bodies, for example, many
prosthetic devices.
e. Cardiac procedures:
i. Echocardiography: Echocardiography uses ultrasonography to delin-
eate the cardiac size, function, ejection fraction, and presence of valvu-
lar dysfunction.
ii. Angiography: Radiopaque dye is injected into various vessels, and
radiographs or fluoroscopic images are used to determine the vascular
occlusion, cardiac function, or valvular integrity.
iii. Stress treadmill tests: Individuals at risk for coronary heart disease are
monitored for blood pressure, heart rate, and chest pain, and an electro-
cardiogram (ECG) is performed while increasing oxygen demands on
the heart, such as running on a treadmill, are made. Nuclear medicine
imaging of the heart can be added to increase the sensitivity and speci-
ficity of the test. Individuals who cannot run on the treadmill (eg, those
with severe arthritis) may be given medications such as adenosine or
dobutamine to “stress” the heart.
INTERPRETATION OF TEST RESULTS: USING PRETEST
PROBABILITY AND LIKELIHOOD RATIO
Because no test is 100% accurate, it is essential when ordering a test to have some
knowledge of the test’s characteristics, as well as how to apply the test results to an
individual patient’s clinical situation. Let us use the example of a patient with chest
pain. The first diagnostic concern of most patients and physicians regarding chest
pain is angina pectoris, that is, the pain of myocardial ischemia caused by coronary
insufficiency. Distinguishing angina pectoris from other causes of chest pain relies
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 8 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,36,"SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS 9
upon two important factors: the clinical history and an understanding of how to
use objective testing. In making the diagnosis of angina pectoris, the clinician must
establish whether the pain satisfies the three criteria for typical anginal pain:
(1) retrosternal in location, (2) precipitated by exertion, and (3) relieved within minutes
by rest or nitroglycerin. Then, the clinician considers other factors, such as patient
age and other risk factors, to determine a pretest probability for angina pectoris.
After a pretest probability is estimated by applying some combination of sta-
tistical data, epidemiology of the disease, and clinical experience, the next decision
is whether and how to use an objective test. A test should only be ordered if the
results would change the posttest probability high enough or low enough in either
direction that it will affect the decision-making process. For example, a 21-year-old
woman with chest pain that is not exertional and not relieved by rest or nitroglyc-
erin has a very low pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), and any
positive results on a cardiac stress test are very likely to be false positive. Any test
result is unlikely to change her management; thus, the test should not be obtained.
Similarly, a 69-year-old diabetic smoker with a recent coronary angioplasty who now
has recurrent episodes of typical angina has a very high pretest probability that the
pain is a result of myocardial ischemia. One could argue that a negative cardiac stress
test is likely to be falsely negative, and that the clinician should proceed directly to
a coronary angiography to assess for a repeat angioplasty. Diagnostic tests, therefore,
are usually most useful for those patients in the midranges of pretest probabilities in
whom a positive or negative test will move the clinician past some decision threshold.
In the case of diagnosing a patient with atherosclerotic CAD, one test that is fre-
quently used is the exercise treadmill test. Patients are monitored on an ECG while
they perform graded exercise on a treadmill. A positive test is the development of
ST-segment depression during the test; the greater the degree of ST depression,
the more useful the test becomes in raising the posttest probability of CAD. In the
example illustrated by Figure I–1, if a patient has a pretest probability of CAD of
50%, then the test result of 2 mm of ST-segment depression raises the posttest
probability to 90%.
If one knows the sensitivity and specificity of the test used, one can calculate
the likelihood ratio of the positive test as sensitivity/(1 – specificity). Posttest prob-
ability is calculated by multiplying the positive likelihood ratio by the pretest prob-
ability, or plotting the probabilities using a nomogram (see Figure I–1).
Thus, knowing something about the characteristics of the test you are employ-
ing and how to apply them to the patient at hand are essential in reaching a correct
diagnosis and to avoid falling into the common trap of “positive test = disease” and
“negative test = no disease.” Stated another way, tests do not make diagnoses; providers
do, considering test results quantitatively in the context of their clinical assessment.

Part 2. Approach to Clinical Problem-Solving
There are typically four distinct steps to the systematic solving of clinical problems:
1. Making the diagnosis
2. Assessing the severity of the disease (stage)
3. Rendering a treatment based on the stage of the disease
4. Following the patient’s response to the treatment
MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS
There are two ways to make a diagnosis. Experienced clinicians often make a diag-
nosis very quickly using pattern recognition, that is, the features of the patient’s
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 10 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,38,"SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS 11
illness match a scenario the provider has seen before. If it does not fit a readily
recognized pattern, then one has to undertake several steps in diagnostic reasoning:
1. The first step is to gather information with a differential diagnosis in mind. The
clinician should start considering diagnostic possibilities with initial contact
with the patient; these possibilities are continually refined as information is
gathered. Historical questions and physical examination tests and findings are
all tailored to the potential diagnoses one is considering. This is the principle
that “you find what you are looking for.” When one is trying to perform a thor-
ough head-to-toe examination, for instance, without looking for anything in
particular, one is much more likely to miss findings.
2. The next step is to try to move from subjective complaints or nonspecific
symptoms to focus on objective abnormalities in an effort to conceptualize
the patient’s objective problem with the greatest specificity one can achieve. For
example, a patient may come to the physician complaining of pedal edema, a
relatively common and nonspecific finding. Laboratory testing may reveal that
the patient has renal failure, a more specific cause of the many causes of edema.
Examination of the urine may then reveal red blood cell casts, indicating glo-
merulonephritis, which is even more specific as the cause of the renal failure.
The patient’s problem, then, described with the greatest degree of specificity, is
glomerulonephritis. The clinician’s task at this point is to consider the differen-
tial diagnosis of glomerulonephritis rather than that of pedal edema.
3. The last step is to look for discriminating features of the patient’s illness. This
means the features of the illness, which by their presence or their absence nar-
row the differential diagnosis. This is often difficult for junior learners because
it requires a well-developed knowledge base of the typical features of disease so
the diagnostician can judge how much weight to assign to the various clinical
clues present. For example, in the diagnosis of a patient with a fever and pro-
ductive cough, the finding by chest x-ray of bilateral apical infiltrates with cavi-
tation is highly discriminatory. There are few illnesses besides tuberculosis
that are likely to produce that radiographic pattern. A negatively predictive
example is a patient with exudative pharyngitis who also has rhinorrhea and
cough. The presence of these features makes the diagnosis of streptococcal
infection unlikely as the cause of the pharyngitis. Once the differential diagno-
sis has been constructed, the clinician uses the presence of discriminating fea-
tures, knowledge of patient risk factors, and the epidemiology of diseases to
decide which potential diagnoses are most likely.
CLINICAL PEARL
There are three steps in diagnostic reasoning:
»
1. Gathering information with a differential diagnosis in mind
2. Identifying the objective abnormalities with the greatest specificity
3. Looking for discriminating features to narrow the differential diagnosis
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 11 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,39,"12 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Once the most specific problem has been identified and a differential diagno-
sis of that problem is considered using discriminating features to order the pos-
sibilities, the next step is to consider using diagnostic testing, such as laboratory,
radiologic, or pathologic data, to confirm the diagnosis. Quantitative reasoning
in the use and interpretation of tests was discussed in Part 1. Clinically, the
timing and effort with which one pursues a definitive diagnosis using objective
data depend on several factors: the potential gravity of the diagnosis in question,
the clinical state of the patient, the potential risks of diagnostic testing, and the
potential benefits or harms of empiric treatment. For example, if a young man is
admitted to the hospital with bilateral pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray, there
are many possibilities, including metastatic malignancy, and aggressive pursuit
of a diagnosis is necessary, perhaps including a thoracotomy with an open-lung
biopsy. The same radiographic findings in an elderly bed-bound woman with
advanced Alzheimer dementia who would not be a good candidate for chemo-
therapy might be best left alone without any diagnostic testing. Decisions like
this are difficult, require solid medical knowledge, as well as a thorough under-
standing of one’s patient and the patient’s background and inclinations. Thus,
this combination of skills constitute the art of medicine.
ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
After ascertaining the diagnosis, the next step is to characterize the severity of the
disease process; in other words, it is describing “how bad” a disease is. There is
usually prognostic or treatment significance based on the stage. With malignancy,
this is done formally by cancer staging. Most cancers are categorized from stage I
(localized) to stage IV (widely metastatic). Some diseases, such as congestive heart
failure, may be designated as mild, moderate, or severe based on the patient’s func-
tional status, that is, their ability to exercise before becoming dyspneic. With some
infections, such as syphilis, the staging depends on the duration and extent of the
infection and follows along the natural history of the infection (ie, primary syphilis,
secondary, latent period, and tertiary/neurosyphilis).
RENDERING A TREATMENT BASED ON
THE STAGE OF THE DISEASE
Many illnesses are stratified according to severity because prognosis and treatment
often vary based on the severity. If neither the prognosis nor the treatment was
affected by the stage of the disease process, there would not be a reason to subcat-
egorize as mild or severe. As an example, a man with mild chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD) may be treated with inhaled bronchodilators as needed
and advice for smoking cessation. However, an individual with severe COPD may
need round-the-clock oxygen supplementation, scheduled bronchodilators, and
possibly oral corticosteroid therapy.
The treatment should be tailored to the extent or “stage” of the disease. In making
decisions regarding treatment, it is also essential that the clinician identify the ther-
apeutic objectives. When patients seek medical attention, it is generally because
they are bothered by a symptom and want it to go away. When clinicians institute
therapy, they often have several other goals besides symptom relief, such as
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 12 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,40,"SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS 13
prevention of short- or long-term complications or a reduction in mortality.
For example, patients with congestive heart failure are bothered by the symptoms
of edema and dyspnea. Salt restriction, loop diuretics, and bed rest are effective at
reducing these symptoms. However, heart failure is a progressive disease with high
mortality, so other treatments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
and some beta-blockers, are also used to reduce mortality in this condition. It is
essential that the clinician know what the therapeutic objective is so that one can
monitor and guide therapy.
CLINICAL PEARL
The clinician needs to identify the objectives of therapy: symptom relief,
»
prevention of complications, or reduction in mortality.
FOLLOWING THE PATIENT’S RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT
The final step in the approach to disease is to follow the patient’s response to the
therapy. The “measure” of response should be recorded and monitored. Some
responses are clinical, such as the patient’s abdominal pain, temperature, or pul-
monary examination. Obviously, the student must work on being more skilled in
eliciting the data in an unbiased and standardized manner. Other responses may
be followed by imaging tests, such as CT scan of a retroperitoneal node size in a
patient receiving chemotherapy, or a tumor marker such as the prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) level in a man receiving chemotherapy for prostatic cancer. For
syphilis, it may be the nonspecific treponemal antibody test rapid plasma reagent
(RPR) titer over time. The student must be prepared to know what to do if the
measured marker does not respond according to what is expected. Is the next step
to re-treat, to repeat the metastatic workup, or to follow up with another more
specific test?
Part 3. Approach to Reading
The clinical problem-oriented approach to reading is different from the classic
“systematic” research of a disease. Patients rarely present with a clear diagnosis;
hence, the student must become skilled in applying the textbook information to
the clinical setting. Furthermore, one retains more information when one reads
with a purpose. In other words, the student should read with the goal of answer-
ing specific questions. There are several fundamental questions that facilitate
clinical thinking. These questions are as follows:
1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
2. What should be the next step?
3. What is the most likely mechanism for this process?
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 13 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,41,"14 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
4. What are the risk factors for this condition?
5. What are the complications associated with the disease process?
6. What is the best therapy?
7. How would you confirm the diagnosis?
CLINICAL PEARL
Reading with the purpose of answering the seven fundamental clinical
»
questions improves retention of information and facilitates the applica-
tion of “book knowledge” to “clinical knowledge.”
WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSIS?
The method of establishing the diagnosis was discussed in the previous part. One
way of attacking this problem is to develop standard “approaches” to common-
clinical problems. It is helpful to understand the most common causes of various
presentations, such as “the most common causes of pancreatitis are gallstones and
alcohol.” (See the Clinical Pearls at end of each case.)
The clinical scenario would entail something such as
A 28-year-old pregnant woman complains of severe epigastric pain radiating to
the back, nausea and vomiting, and an elevated serum amylase level. What is the
most likely diagnosis?
With no other information to go on, the student would note that this woman
has a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis. Using the “most common cause” informa-
tion, the student would make an educated guess that the patient has gallstones,
because being female and pregnant are risk factors. If, instead, cholelithiasis is
removed from the equation of this scenario, a phrase may be added, such as
“The ultrasonogram of the gallbladder shows no stones.”
CLINICAL PEARL
Knowing how diseases present and the most common conditions in
»
certain populations can point to likely diagnoses.
Now, the student would use the phrase, “patients without gallstones who have
pancreatitis most likely abuse alcohol.” Aside from these two causes, there are many
other etiologies of pancreatitis.
WHAT SHOULD BE THE NEXT STEP?
The question, “what is the next step” is difficult because the next step may be
more diagnostic information, staging, or therapy. It may be more challenging than
“the most likely diagnosis” because there may be insufficient information to make
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 14 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,42,"SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS 15
a diagnosis, and the next step may be to pursue more diagnostic information.
Another possibility is that there is enough information for a probable diagnosis,
and the next step is to stage the disease. Finally, the most appropriate action may be
to treat. Hence, from clinical data, a judgment needs to be rendered regarding how
far along one is on this road:
Make a diagnosis ã Stage the disease ã Treatment based on stage ã Follow response
Frequently, the student is taught to regurgitate the same information that some-
one has written about a particular disease but is not skilled at giving the next step.
This talent is learned optimally at the bedside, in a supportive environment, with
freedom to make educated guesses, and with constructive feedback. A sample sce-
nario may describe a student’s thought process as follows:
1. Make the diagnosis: “Based on the information I have, I believe that
Mr. Smith has stable angina because he has retrosternal chest pain when he
walks three blocks, but it is relieved within minutes by rest and with sublingual
nitroglycerin.”
2. Stage the disease: “I don’t believe that this is severe disease because he does not
have pain lasting for more than 5 minutes, angina at rest, or congestive heart
failure.”
3. Treatment based on stage: “Therefore, my next step is to treat with aspirin,
beta-blockers, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as well as lifestyle changes.”
4. Follow response: “I want to follow the treatment by assessing his pain (I will
ask him about the degree of exercise he is able to perform without chest pain),
performing a cardiac stress test, and reassessing him after the test is done.”
In a similar patient, when the clinical presentation is unclear or more severe,
perhaps the best “next step” may be diagnostic in nature, such as a thallium stress
test or even coronary angiography. The next step depends upon the clinical state of
the patient (if unstable, the next step is therapeutic), the potential severity of the
disease (the next step may be staging), or the uncertainty of the diagnosis (the next
step is diagnostic).
Usually, the vague question, “What is your next step?” is the most difficult ques-
tion because the answer may be diagnostic, staging, or therapeutic.
WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY MECHANISM FOR THIS PROCESS?
The question of the most likely mechanism for the process not only goes fur-
ther than making the diagnosis, but it also requires the student to understand
the underlying mechanism for the process. For example, a clinical scenario may
describe an “18-year-old woman who presents with several months of severe epi-
staxis, heavy menses, petechiae, and a normal CBC except for a platelet count
of 15,000/mm3.” Answers that a student may consider to explain this condi-
tion include immune-mediated platelet destruction, drug-induced thrombo-
cytopenia, bone marrow suppression, and platelet sequestration as a result of
hypersplenism.
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 15 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,43,"16 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
The student is advised to learn the mechanisms for each disease process and
not merely memorize a constellation of symptoms. In other words, rather than
solely committing to memory the classic presentation of idiopathic thrombocy-
topenic purpura (ITP) (isolated thrombocytopenia without lymphadenopathy or
offending drugs), the student should understand that ITP is an autoimmune pro-
cess whereby the body produces immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies against the
platelets. The platelet-antibody complexes are then taken from the circulation in
the spleen. Because the disease process is specific for platelets, the other two cell
lines (erythrocytes and leukocytes) are normal. Also, because the thrombocyto-
penia is caused by excessive platelet peripheral destruction, the bone marrow will
show increased megakaryocytes (platelet precursors). Hence, treatment for ITP
includes oral corticosteroid agents to decrease the immune process of antiplatelet
IgG production, and, if refractory, then splenectomy.
WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR THIS PROCESS?
Understanding the risk factors helps the practitioner to establish a diagnosis and
to determine how to interpret tests. For example, understanding the risk factor
analysis may help to manage a 45-year-old obese woman with sudden onset of
dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain following an orthopedic surgery for a femur
fracture. This patient has numerous risk factors for deep venous thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism. The clinician may want to pursue angiography even if the
ventilation/perfusion scan result is low probability. Thus, the number of risk
factors helps to categorize the likelihood of a disease process.
For infrequent diseases (eg, lung cancer), the risk factors are identified as odds
ratios: These represent the probability of the event (lung cancer) in the presence of
an exposure (smoking), divided by that probability in absence of the exposure. We
know now not only that smoking is more common in patients with lung cancer, but
also the mechanisms that explain the causality. Nevertheless, odds ratios can be
explained as follows: If your patient has lung cancer, it is more likely that he or she
smokes than he or she does not. Most smokers do not have lung cancer.
CLINICAL PEARL
Risk factors help clinicians to have a higher index of suspicion for disease
»
and perhaps modify their diagnostic strategy.
WHAT ARE THE COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
DISEASE PROCESS?
A clinician must understand the complications of a disease so that one may monitor
the patient. Sometimes, the student has to make the diagnosis from clinical clues
and then apply his or her knowledge of the sequelae of the pathologic process. For
example, the student should know that chronic hypertension may affect various end
organs, such as the brain (encephalopathy or stroke), the eyes (vascular changes),
01_Toy_IM_Sec01_p001-018.indd 16 11/08/20 7:28 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,44,"SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS 17
the kidneys, and the heart. Understanding the types of consequences also helps the
clinician to be aware of the dangers to a patient. The clinician is acutely aware of
the need to monitor for the end-organ involvement and undertakes the appropriate
intervention when involvement is present.
WHAT IS THE BEST THERAPY?
To answer this question, the clinician needs to reach the correct diagnosis, assess
the severity of the condition, and weigh the situation to reach the appropriate
intervention. For the student, knowing exact dosages is not as important as under-
standing the best medication, route of delivery, mechanism of action, and possible
complications. It is important for the student to be able to verbalize the diagnosis
and the rationale for the therapy. A common error is for the student to “jump to a
treatment,” like a random guess, and therefore be given “right or wrong” feedback.
In fact, the student’s guess may be correct, but for the wrong reason; conversely,
the answer may be a very reasonable one, with only one small error in thinking.
Instead, the student should verbalize the steps so that feedback may be given at
every reasoning point.
For example, if the question is, “What is the best therapy for a 25-year-old man
who complains of a nontender penile ulcer?” the incorrect manner of response is
for the student to blurt out “azithromycin.” Rather, the student should reason it out
in a way similar to this: “The most common cause of a nontender infectious ulcer
of the penis is syphilis. Nontender adenopathy is usually associated. Therefore, the
best treatment for this man with probable syphilis is intramuscular penicillin (but
I would want to confirm the diagnosis). His partner also needs treatment.”
Frequently, clinicians face the need for rapid decision-making. With little evi-
dence in their hands, they need to decide whether an acutely ill-appearing patient
needs treatment for a likely, yet unproven, diagnosis. The clinician’s experience
plays an essential role in deciding when to start a treatment before the final diagno-
sis is established.
CLINICAL PEARL
Therapy should be logically based on the severity of disease. Antibiotic
»
therapy should be tailored for specific organisms.
HOW WOULD YOU CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS?
In the previous scenario, the man with a nontender penile ulcer is likely to have
syphilis. Confirmation may be achieved by serology (RPR or Venereal Disease
Research Laboratory [VDRL] test); however, there is a significant possibility that
patients with primary syphilis may not have developed antibody response yet and
have negative serology. Thus, confirmation of the diagnosis is attained with dark-
field microscopy. Knowing the limitations of diagnostic tests and the manifesta-
tions of disease aids in this area.

SUMMARY
1. There is no replacement for a careful history and physical examination.
2. There are four steps to the clinical approach to the patient: making the diagno-
sis, assessing severity, treatment based on severity, and following response.
3. Assessment of pretest probability and knowledge of test characteristics are
essential in the application of test results to the clinical situation.
4. There are seven questions that help to bridge the gap between the textbook and
the clinical arena.

A 66-year-old woman comes in for a routine physical examination. She reports
going through menopause at age 51. Her other medical and family history is
unremarkable. Social history is remarkable for a 30 pack-year smoking history. On
examination, she is found to have a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate of
70 beats per minute (bpm), and temperature of 98 °F. Her weight is 140 lb, and her
height is 5 ft 4 in. The thyroid is normal to palpation. Breast examination reveals no
masses or discharge. Abdominal, cardiac, and lung evaluations are within normal
limits. Pelvic examination shows a normal multiparous cervix, a normal-sized
uterus, and no adnexal masses. She had undergone a mammogram 3 months ago.
The patient states that she has regular Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and that the last
one, performed 1 year ago, was normal.

Health Maintenance
Summary: A 66-year-old woman presents with
30 pack-year smoking history

Mammogram performed 3 months ago

Last Pap smear, normal, a year ago

Next step: Each of the following should be performed: colorectal cancer screening,
lung cancer screening, dyslipidemia and blood glucose screening, immunizations
(pneumococcal vaccine, herpes zoster vaccine, influenza vaccine, tetanus vaccine
[if not within 10 years]), and smoking cessation counseling.
Most common cause of mortality: Cardiovascular disease.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe which health maintenance studies should be performed for a patient
older than 65 years. (EPA 1, 3)
2. Recognize the most common cause of mortality in a woman in this age group.
(EPA 12)
3. Verbalize that preventive maintenance consists of immunizations, cancer
screening, and screening for common diseases. (EPA 1, 12)
Considerations
The approach to health maintenance consists of three parts: (1) screening for cancer,
cardiovascular disease, or other conditions; (2) immunizations; and (3) behavioral
counseling regarding healthy behaviors such as regular exercise and tobacco cessation.
For a 66-year-old woman, cancer screening includes mammography for breast cancer
screening every 2 years until age 74 and colon cancer screening every 10 years with a
colonoscopy until age 75 (can also screen with fecal occult blood testing annually or
flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years). Because this patient is a current smoker with
a 30 pack-year history, lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomographic
(CT) chest scan is also warranted. Cervical cancer screening can be stopped at age
65 if all previous Pap smears have been normal. Screening for cardiovascular disease
includes high blood pressure screening every year and testing for dyslipidemia in men
starting at age 35 and in women starting at age 45 or sooner if there are risk factors
such as family history, history of diabetes, tobacco use, or body mass index (BMI)
greater than 30. Immunizations for this patient would include tetanus booster every
10 years, pneumococcal vaccine, herpes zoster vaccine, and yearly influenza immuni-
zation. Screening for abnormal blood glucose levels is also recommended. The most
common cause of mortality in men or women over 65 is cardiovascular disease.

APPROACH TO:
Health Maintenance
DEFINITIONS
COST-EFFECTIVENESS: Comparison of resources expended in an interven-
tion versus the benefit, which may be measured in life-years or quality-adjusted
life-years (QALY).
PRIMARY PREVENTION: Identifying and modifying risk factors in subjects
who have never had the disease of concern.
SCREENING TEST: Device used to identify asymptomatic disease in the hope
that early detection will lead to an improved outcome. An optimal screening test
has high sensitivity and specificity, is inexpensive, is easy to perform, and has read-
ily available treatment for the disease being screened for.
SECONDARY PREVENTION: Actions taken to reduce the morbidity or mortality
once a disease has been diagnosed.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Preventive Care
Aside from care focused on treating acute or chronic illnesses, a cornerstone of
medical practice includes preventive care. As stated in the modern Hippocratic
Oath, “I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.”
A directed approach to intervene on common pathologies helps keep patients
healthy or detects disease early enough that interventions are more effective.
There are several types of preventive care:
1. Immunizations: Aside from childhood immunizations, routine adult immu-
nizations include influenza, pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular
pertussis (Td/Tdap), zoster, as well as others, such as hepatitis A or B vaccines,
in certain situations.
2. Behavioral counseling: Inquiry and counseling regarding regular exercise,
avoidance or cessation of tobacco, moderate alcohol use, and screening for
depression.
3. Chemoprevention: Use of medication to prevent disease, such as use of statin
therapy to prevent cardiovascular events.
4. Screening: Identification of disease or risk factors in an asymptomatic patient.
Of these preventive measures, screening requires firm medical evidence that
it may offer benefit, and thoughtful consideration from the practitioner before
he or she initiates screening and recommends to an asymptomatic patient that
he or she undergoes a medical intervention with potential harms (eg, cost,
02_Toy-IM_Case01_p019-028.indd 23 03/09/20 9:19 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,51,"24 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
radiation exposure, anxiety regarding false-positive tests, biopsies, or other
follow-up examinations). The World Health Organization outlined the follow-
ing principles of screening:
1. The condition must be an important health problem.
2. There should be an effective treatment for the condition.
3. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of the condition should be available to
the patient.
4. There needs to be a latent or preclinical stage of the disease in which it can
be detected.
5. There should be an accurate test to detect the condition.
6. The test should be acceptable to the patient or the population.
7. The natural history of the disease should be understood to guide intervention
or treatment.
8. The cost of case-finding should be balanced within the context of overall
medical expenditures.
Using these criteria, one may deduce that it would not be useful to screen for
Alzheimer disease since there is no curative treatment and no evidence that early
intervention alters the course of the disease. Regarding cost-effectiveness, health
care economists perform sophisticated analysis for screening and other medical
care, but one rough measure of cost-effectiveness is QALY, combining longevity
with quality of life as a single measurement. In the United States, medical interven-
tions, including cancer screening, are often considered cost-effective at a cost of
$50,000 to $100,000 per QALY gained.
Health Maintenance by Age Group
Among Americans between ages 15 and 45, accidents and homicide are the leading
causes of death, so preventive care may include counseling regarding behavioral
risk reduction, such as seatbelt use, avoiding alcohol or texting while driving, or
substance abuse. It is important to consider that the rising prevalence of obesity
in younger populations may necessitate earlier screening of cardiovascular disease,
including dyslipidemia, blood pressure, and abnormal blood glucose, which are
reflected in newer guidelines.
After age 45, the leading causes of death are malignancy and cardiovascular
disease, so screening is focused on risk factor reduction for those diseases, such
as control of blood pressure and hyperlipidemia and early detection of cancers.
Regarding cancer screening tests, the American Cancer Society and various sub-
specialty organizations publish various recommendations, which are often not in
agreement. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent
panel of physicians and epidemiologists appointed by the Department of Health
and Human Services to systematically review the evidence of effectiveness of clini-
cal preventive services (though they do not consider cost-effectiveness). Offer-
ing cancer screening to older patients should consider estimated life expectancy
02_Toy-IM_Case01_p019-028.indd 24 03/09/20 9:19 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,52,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 25
(typically at least 10 years), comorbid conditions, and ability or willingness to
undergo cancer treatment if a cancer is detected (eg, to tolerate a hemicolectomy
if a colon cancer is found). The USPSTF recommendations for cancer and other
health screenings are listed in Table 1–1.

The use of vaccinations is another important component of preventive health in
older adults. Routine immunizations include annual influenza vaccine (especially
important in the geriatric population since >90% of influenza-related deaths occur
in patients over 60 years), pneumococcal vaccines (23-valent polysaccharide
vaccine [PPSV23] and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13] should
be given sequentially), and herpes zoster live-attenuated vaccine for immuno-
competent patients over age 60 or recombinant herpes zoster vaccine for patients
over age 50.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
1.1 A 59-year-old woman is being seen for a health maintenance appointment. She
has not seen a doctor for over 10 years. She had undergone a total hysterec-
tomy for uterine fibroids 12 years ago. The patient takes supplemental calcium.
The provider orders a fasting glucose level, lipid panel, mammogram, colonos-
copy, and a Pap smear of the vaginal cuff. Which of the following statements is
most appropriate regarding the screening for this patient?
A. The Pap smear of the vaginal cuff is unnecessary.
B. In general, colon cancer screening should be initiated at age 60, but this
patient has very sporadic care; therefore, colonoscopy is reasonable.
C. Because the patient takes supplemental calcium, a dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is not needed.
D. Pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended.
1.2 A 65-year-old man has had annual health maintenance appointments and has
followed all the recommendations offered by his primary care provider. The
practitioner counsels him about pneumococcal vaccine. Which of the follow-
ing is the most appropriate statement about this vaccine?
A. It is recommended for patients who are age 60 and older.
B. The vaccination is administered in a two-dose series.
C. The pneumococcal vaccination consists of only a conjugate vaccine.
D. This vaccine is not recommended if a patient is immunocompromised.

ANSWERS
1.1 A. Cervical cytology of the vaginal cuff is unnecessary when the hysterectomy
was for benign indications (not cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer) and when
there is no history of abnormal Pap smears. Colon cancer screening (answer B)
is generally started at age 45 or 50 and not at age 60. DEXA scan for osteopo-
rosis (answer C) is recommended for women starting at age 65 or earlier for
women with elevated fracture risk. Pneumococcal vaccine (answer D) is gener-
ally given at age 65.
1.2 B. The pneumococcal vaccine actually consists of two vaccines (not one,
as in answer C), PCV13 vaccine and PPSV23. It is recommended to give
the PCV13 vaccine at age 65 (not age 60, as in answer A), followed 1 year
later by PPSV23. Conjugate vaccines induce a T-cell–dependent immune
response for longer-lasting immunity, while polysaccharide vaccines induce a
T-independent response that achieves relative immunity in adults and older
children. It is recommended for individuals aged 65 and above and sooner
for those with certain medical conditions or an immunocompromised state
(answer D). It has been shown to greatly reduce the incidence of bacte-
rial pneumonia and associated complications, such as bacteremia and men-
ingitis. Pneumococcal disease affects 18,000 older adults every year in the
United States, and growing strains of antibiotic-resistant organisms make
the vaccine all the more important.
1.3 A. Cervical cytology should be deferred until age 21. This is due to the fact that
adolescents many times will clear the HPV infection and cause an abnormal
Pap smear to normalize. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommends that the HPV vaccine should be recommended to both
males and females between the ages of 9 and 26 (not dependent on history
of genital warts, as in answer B). The most common cause of mortality for
adolescent girls is motor vehicle accidents (not suicide, as in answer C).
No vaccine is currently available for hepatitis C (answer D).

A 46-year-old man comes to the internal medicine clinic for an annual checkup.
He has no current complaints. He has just moved from Michigan, where he was an
autoworker. While living in Michigan, he regularly saw his primary care provider
once a year. His previous medical records are currently unavailable. The patient
reports a history of hypertension, diagnosed 6 years earlier, without known
complications. He has been adherent to his prescribed medications of lisinopril/
hydrochlorothiazide. He states that he checks his blood pressure weekly, and
that “his numbers are normal.” He smokes 10 cigarettes per day but is open to
quitting. On examination, his blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg, his pulse is regular
at 70 beats per minute (bpm), and his temperature is 98 °F. His body mass index
(BMI) is 27 kg/m2. His heart examination shows normal S and S without murmurs,
1 2
gallops, or rubs. His lungs are clear to auscultation. No bruits are heard on the
neck, abdomen, or flank regions. His abdominal and neurologic exams are normal.
Preclinic laboratory tests show normal cell blood count, normal liver and kidney
function tests, normal urinalysis, hemoglobin A (Hb A ) of 6%, total cholesterol
1c 1c
of 210 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, and low-

ANSWERS TO CASE 2:
Metabolic Syndrome
Summary: A 46-year-old man presents for a checkup with
Elevated BMI

Elevated blood pressure while on pharmacological treatment

Current cigarette use

Elevated LDL cholesterol and a borderline Hb A
 1C
How do his conditions affect his cardiovascular risk? The patient has multiple risk
factors, such as hypertension, elevated BMI, prediabetes, dyslipidemia, and current
cigarette use, which increase his cardiovascular risk.
Next management step: Use the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
10-year risk calculator to determine the patient’s risk of developing cardiovascular
disease (CVD), which will guide management of the patient’s conditions.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Define metabolic syndrome. (EPA 12)
2. Recognize the value of the ASCVD calculator for determining patient’s risk.
(EPA 1, 4, 7)
3. Outline the treatment options when individual or multiple cardiovascular risk
factors are present. (EPA 4)
Considerations
The three most important issues for this patient are (1) the diagnosis of metabolic
syndrome based on physical examination and laboratory findings, (2) identification
of modifiable risk factors, and (3) incorporating lifestyle modifications and phar-
macological therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality.
APPROACH TO:
Metabolic Syndrome
DEFINITIONS
ASCVD RISK CALCULATOR: Estimates the risk of developing myocardial
infarction or stroke over the following 10 years. This risk estimate can help clini-
cians identify patients who would benefit from primary prevention. Components
of the risk calculator are listed in Table 2–1.

• Smoker
Abbreviation: ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Components of the pooled cohort equation to calculate the risk of developing ASCVD over next 10 years.
ATHEROSCLEROTIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (ASCVD): The dis-
ease caused by atherosclerotic plaque buildup in vessel walls, which can lead to
coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and aor-
tic disease.
BODY MASS INDEX (BMI): A measurement of the patient’s body weight in
kilograms over the square of height in meters. It is an inexpensive screening tool
used alongside other diagnostic tests.
METABOLIC SYNDROME: Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of intercon-
nected risk factors that increase one’s chances of developing diabetes, stroke, and
heart disease.
WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO: Ratio of circumference of waist to hip. It is a surrogate
marker for abdominal fat distribution. Increased waist-to-hip ratio is highly cor-
related with increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and premature death.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated clinical syndromes of insu-
lin resistance, central obesity, raised triglycerides, reduced HDL, and hyperten-
sion. Overall, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is approximately 34% in
the United States. The prevalence is over 50% in Americans older than 60. The
prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been historically higher in older adults, but
it is now increasing among younger patients due to increasing obesity and diabe-
tes rates. There are also significant variations in the prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome among different ethnicities. Native Americans, African Americans, and
Mexican Americans have higher rates of metabolic syndrome as compared to age-
matched non-Hispanic white Americans or Chinese Americans, likely due more
to social factors than genetic predisposition. In addition, there are geographic
variations in the rates of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The
500 Cities project, a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), the CDC Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-
dation, revealed significant differences in the rates of chronic diseases and health
03_Toy-IM_Case02_p029-038.indd 31 03/09/20 9:18 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,59,"32 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
outcomes among 500 of the largest cities in the United States (https//www.cdc
:
.gov/500cities/index.htm). For example, the prevalence of hypertension is 35.2%
in Charleston, West Virginia, compared to 10.7% in College Station, Texas. This
varying prevalence of chronic conditions may lead to significantly different local
prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared to national averages. Those with
metabolic syndrome are five times more likely to develop diabetes mellitus (DM),
three times more likely to develop ASCVD, and two times more likely to develop
chronic kidney disease; therefore, it is imperative to screen and treat patients in
the primary care setting.
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome is not well understood, but it is likely
multifactorial. The most well-accepted hypothesis is that metabolic syndrome
stems from resistance of peripheral tissue to insulin, which in turn causes the pan-
creas to release more insulin to maintain euglycemia. This hyperinsulinemia leads
to increased lipolysis and the release of more free fatty acids (FFAs). Increased
circulation of FFAs not only further reduces insulin sensitivity of the peripheral
tissue but also leads to increased production of glucose and triglycerides, as well
as altered cholesterol metabolism in the liver. In addition, FFAs generate reactive
oxygen species, which causes endothelial dysfunction. Hyperinsulinemia can acti-
vate the sympathetic nervous system. These mechanisms together can likely lead
to the hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia observed in patients with
metabolic syndrome.
Clinical Presentation
There are no specific clinical symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome.
A patient may present to the primary care clinic with symptoms associated with
obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Diagnostic criteria for
metabolic syndrome are listed in Table 2–2.
Table 2–2 • DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME
Central obesity with increased waist circumference
• ≥ 37 in for men
• ≥ 31 in for women
Triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL
Fasting blood sugars ≥ 100 mg/dL
Hypertension with systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mm Hg
Reduced HDL
• ≤ 40 mg/dL in men
• ≤ 50 mg/dL in women
Diagnostic criteria per International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) worldwide definition of metabolic syndrome. The diagno-
sis of metabolic syndrome requires three of the five criteria. Of note, the criteria for central obesity are country and ethnic-
ity specific, and the United States specific guidelines are listed in the table. Please refer to IDF consensus guidelines for
other country-specific central obesity cutoffs.

Patients often seek medical care due to obesity. Though imperfect, BMI is a non-
invasive and an inexpensive screening tool that has been correlated with adverse
cardiovascular events. As the BMI measurement does not account for body compo-
sition, gender, or age, BMI may not be accurate in elderly patients (who tend to have
more adipose tissue compared to younger patients), women (who have higher total
body fat for the equivalent BMI), or muscular individuals (who have lower body fat
for the equivalent BMI). Recent studies have demonstrated that waist circumference,
waist-to-hip ratio, and neck circumference are additional surrogate markers that are
associated with increased risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, and coronary artery
disease. In addition, patients may present to the clinic for an evaluation of menstrual
cycle abnormalities, hirsutism, daytime sleepiness, or chronic fatigue due to polycys-
tic ovary syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea.
Patients with severe insulin resistance may have acanthosis nigricans. Those
who have already developed DM may have polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, blurry
vision, peripheral neuropathy, or recurrent urinary tract infections. Uncontrolled
hypertension may manifest as visual disturbances or episodic headaches.
In addition to hypertension and obesity on the physical examination, the
patient’s blood work may reveal elevated fasting serum glucose, Hb A , triglycer-
1C
ides, LDL, or reduced HDL. Patients who have diabetes or hypertension may also
have proteinuria on urinalysis.
Treatment
Screening. Patients at risk of developing metabolic syndrome should be screened
routinely. In addition to measuring BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fast-
ing blood glucose levels, and lipid panel, level and intensity of daily physical activity
and typical food intake should be assessed. In the absence of management recom-
mendations based on randomized controlled trials, clinicians should focus on indi-
vidual components of metabolic syndrome to reduce the risk of developing CVD
and DM.
Lifestyle Modification. Lifestyle modification is the mainstay of treatment.
Smoking is one of the biggest modifiable risk factors for developing CVD. Patients’
tobacco use should be assessed at every visit, and smoking cessation interventions
should be provided to all patients. The United States Preventive Services Task
Force recommends the 5A approach for smoking cessation Ask about tobacco use,
:
Advise to quit, Assess willingness to quit, Assist to quit, and Arrange for follow-up.
Patients who are ambivalent about quitting may benefit from a brief motivational
interview, which can help resolve a patient’s ambivalence about smoking cessa-
tion. A combination of counseling and pharmacologic therapy, including nicotine
replacement therapy, bupropion, or varenicline, is more effective than either coun-
seling or medications alone.
Multiple studies have shown that moderate-intensity physical activity for at least
150 minutes per week is associated with weight loss. Modest weight loss of 5% to
10% has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, fasting blood glucose, HDL,
and triglyceride levels as well as hypertension. In addition to physical activity, diets
rich in fruits, vegetables, fiber, unsaturated fats, and complex carbohydrates in
03_Toy-IM_Case02_p029-038.indd 33 03/09/20 9:18 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,61,"34 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
which patients avoid saturated fats and sodium can prevent development of CVD
and DM.
Pharmacotherapy. Though the lifestyle modifications are offered as a first-line
option, they are often insufficient in addressing metabolic syndrome. Patients should
be offered pharmacologic therapies for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes to pre-
vent the development of CVD, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accidents.
Using the ASCVD risk calculator, a patient’s 10-year risk of developing CVD
should be assessed. Those with borderline risk (5%-7.5%) and chronic kidney
disease, metabolic syndrome, DM, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or South
Asian ethnicity should be started on moderate-intensity statins. Patients who
have intermediate risk (7.5%-20%) should also be placed on moderate- or high-
intensity statins. All high-risk patients (> 20%) should be prescribed high-intensity
statin therapy.
Clinicians should consider initiating metformin for patients who have impaired
glucose tolerance (IGT). Metformin suppresses hepatic glucose production
and enhances peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity. A large cohort study in the
United Kingdom showed that treatment of patients with IGT with metformin
delayed development of metabolic syndrome and DM. Thiazolidinediones have
also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and delay onset of DM in patients
with prediabetes. Newer agents such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) recep-
tor agonists and sodium glucose transport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may potentially
be useful in treatment of metabolic syndrome as they cause weight loss, improve
insulin sensitivity, and reduce ASCVD; however, more studies are needed to assess
their efficacies.
Similarly, pharmacologic therapies should be considered in patients with blood
pressure > 140/90 mm Hg. An ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs) may be useful particularly in patients with metabolic syndrome
or DM. Angiotensin II affects hypertension by increasing reactive oxygen species
production and impairing nitric oxide generation. Furthermore, angiotensin II aug-
ments hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance. A large-scale metanalysis has
shown that ACEi and ARBs not only improve hypertension but also reduce devel-
opment of new-onset DM.
Bariatric Surgery. Patients with BMI > 35 and DM, hypertension, or severe sleep
apnea—for whom lifestyle modifications have been insufficient—should be offered
bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery was associated with improvement in fasting
glucose, blood pressure, obesity, waist circumference, and cholesterol. As patients
with morbid obesity have increased perioperative complications with bariatric
surgeries, patients should be advised on perioperative as well as long-term risks
associated with the procedure.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
2.1 A 51-year-old man is being seen for an annual physical examination. The
patient’s BMI is 28 kg/m2, blood pressure is 141/72 mm Hg, and heart rate
is 73 bpm. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood count (CBC),
normal basic metabolic panel (BMP), Hb A of 7%, and total cholesterol
1C
of 245 mg/dL. The patient has smoked 1 pack per day for the last 30 years.
He exercises 30 minutes daily. What is the best step in management of this
patient?
A. Calculate the patient’s ASCVD risk score
B. Initiate statin therapy
C. Initiate metformin therapy
D. Assess readiness for smoking cessation
E. Schedule an appointment for a blood pressure check in 1 week
2.2 A 38-year-old woman is being seen by her primary care provider for a regular
follow-up. The patient’s BMI is 34 kg/m2 with significant abdominal adiposity.
The patient has hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia,
which are well controlled with levothyroxine, lisinopril, metformin, and ator-
vastatin. She works as an executive assistant. She has never smoked cigarettes
and does not drink alcohol. What is the next best step in management of the
patient’s metabolic syndrome?
A. Recheck Hb A , fasting lipid panel, triiodothyronine (T ), and thyroid-
1C 3
stimulating hormone (TSH)
B. Refer the patient for bariatric surgery
C. Encourage the patient to perform moderate-intensity physical exercise
D. Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG)
2.3 A 55-year-old man is presenting for an annual examination. The patient’s BMI
is 24 kg/m2. His blood pressure is 123/77 mm Hg with a heart rate of 71 bpm.
The patient’s total cholesterol is 171 mg/dL, HDL is 45 mg/dL, and LDL is
90 mg/dL. Last year, his Hb A was 5.2% and 10-year ASCVD risk score was
1C
4.8%. Laboratory tests drawn today are unremarkable except for elevated Hb
A at 7%. He currently takes no medications. He does not smoke or drink.
1C
What is the next best step in management?
A. Start statin therapy
B. Start metformin therapy
C. Start statin and metformin therapy
D. No further changes necessary

Case Files Internal Medicine,63,"36 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
2.4 A 28-year-old woman is presenting to the primary care clinic for an annual
physical. Her BMI is 48 kg/m2, blood pressure is 145/91 mm Hg, and Hb A
1C
is 8.4%. Her past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, dyslipidemia,
DM, and obstructive sleep apnea. She is currently taking lisinopril, hydro-
chlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and insulin. The patient’s weight has remained
unchanged since the last visit despite starting moderate-intensity exercise and
dietary modifications. The patient endorses chronic fatigue and daytime som-
nolence. Which of the following is the next best step for management of meta-
bolic syndrome?
A. Refer the patient for bariatric surgery
B. Increase insulin dose
C. Add nifedipine
D. Prescribe continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy
ANSWERS
2.1 D. The patient should be evaluated for readiness to quit smoking. If appro-
priate, the patient should be counseled on smoking cessation and prescribed
nicotine replacement therapy. Smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for
developing CVD, and smoking cessation is the most appropriate next step in
managing this patient.
2.2 C. The patient has metabolic syndrome as she has hypertension, diabetes,
abdominal obesity, and hyperlipidemia. Lifestyle modification is the first step
of metabolic syndrome treatment. Studies have shown that 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity exercise per week can significantly improve hypertension,
obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.
2.3 C. This patient is presenting with a new-onset diabetes. The patient had a
10-year ASCVD risk score of 4.8% last year, which has now increased to
9.8% with newly diagnosed diabetes. In addition to encouraging moderate-
intensity exercise, pharmacologic therapies for dyslipidemia and diabetes are
indicated in this patient. Metformin is a first-line agent to treat diabetes.
Per the American Heart Association guidelines, a 10-year ASCVD risk score
between 7.5% and 20% is considered intermediate risk and would necessitate
moderate-intensity statins to lower LDL.
2.4 A. This patient has metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
and DM). Though lifestyle modifications are the first-line interventions for
metabolic syndrome, they are often insufficient. Patients with uncontrolled
diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia remain at increased risk of develop-
ing CVD. To reduce cardiovascular morbidities and mortality, these patients
should be offered bariatric surgery evaluation. Bariatric surgery can improve
fasting glucose level, lipid profile, hypertension, and obesity.

ANSWERS TO CASE 3:
Acute Coronary Syndrome
Summary: A 56-year-old man presents with
Cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and tobacco use)

Acute onset of retrosternal pressure, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis

S on cardiac auscultation, reflecting a stiff left ventricle (LV), which may result from
 4
ischemic myocardium
ECG showing ST elevations and T-wave changes

Most likely diagnosis: Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI)
(STEMI).
Next step in therapy: Administer aspirin and a beta-blocker and assess whether
he is a candidate for rapid reperfusion of the myocardium, that is, treatment with
thrombolytics or percutaneous coronary intervention.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. List the diagnostic criteria for acute MI. (EPA 3, 10)
2. Identify patients who benefit from thrombolytics or percutaneous coronary
intervention. (EPA 4, 10)
3. Describe the complications of MI and their treatment options. (EPA 4, 10)
4. Describe post-MI risk stratification and secondary prevention strategies. (EPA 12)
Considerations
The three most important issues for this patient are (1) the suspicion of acute MI
based on the clinical and ECG findings, (2) deciding whether the patient has indi-
cations or contraindications for thrombolytics or primary percutaneous coronary
intervention, and (3) excluding other diagnoses that might mimic acute MI but
would not benefit from or might be worsened by anticoagulation or thrombolysis
(eg, acute pericarditis, aortic dissection).
APPROACH TO:
Suspected Acute MI
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS): An umbrella term for conditions of
acute cardiac ischemia, usually caused by formation of a thrombus in a coronary
artery. ACS is subdivided into three separate conditions: unstable angina, NSTEMI
04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 40 03/09/20 9:18 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,68,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 41
(non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), and STEMI. These three con-
ditions are distinguished from each other by biomarkers (troponins, CK-MB
[creatine kinase myocardial band]) and ECG changes.
NON–ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (NSTEMI):
Acute cardiac ischemia with death of cardiac myocytes. Death of myocytes results
in intracellular proteins like troponins being leaked into the blood. Thus, NSTEMI
is characterized by presence of troponins without ST elevation on ECG.
ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (STEMI): Acute
cardiac ischemia with transmural cardiac infarction, resulting in ST-segment eleva-
tions of more than 0.1 mV in two or more contiguous leads AND elevated cardiac
biomarkers. STEMI is the most severe form of ACS and is more likely to cause
cardiogenic shock acutely.
THROMBOLYTICS: Drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), strepto-
kinase, and reteplase (recombinant plasminogen activator [r-PA]), which act to lyse
fibrin thrombi in order to restore patency of the coronary artery when percutane-
ous coronary intervention (PCI) is contraindicated or is not available.
UNSTABLE ANGINA: Acute cardiac ischemia without death of cardiac myocytes.
In unstable angina, a typical patient is experiencing chest pain but without serum
troponin elevation and without ST elevation on ECG.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Acute coronary syndromes, which exist on a continuum ranging from unstable
angina pectoris to NSTEMI to STEMI, are usually caused by in situ thrombosis
at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery. Occasionally,
they are caused by embolic occlusion, coronary vasospasm, vasculitis, aortic root
or coronary artery dissection, or cocaine use (which promotes both vasospasm and
thrombosis). The resultant clinical syndrome is related to both the degree of ath-
erosclerotic stenosis in the artery and the duration and extent of sudden thrombotic
occlusion of the artery. If the occlusion is incomplete or if the thrombus undergoes
spontaneous lysis, unstable angina occurs. If the occlusion is complete for longer
than 30 minutes, infarction occurs. In contrast, the mechanism of chronic stable
angina is a flow-limiting stenosis usually caused by atherosclerotic plaque that
causes ischemia during exercise without acute thrombosis (Table 3–1).

Clinical Presentation
Signs and Symptoms. Chest pain is the cardinal feature of MI, even though it is
not universally present (Table 3–2). It is similar to angina pectoris—described as
heavy, squeezing, or crushing—and is localized to the retrosternal area or epigas-
trium, sometimes radiating to the arm, lower jaw, or neck. Unlike stable angina,
however, it persists for more than 30 minutes and is not relieved by rest. The pain
often is accompanied by sweating, nausea, vomiting, and/or the sense of impend-
ing doom. In some patients, chest pain may not be prominent. Diabetics and older
patients may present with only vague discomfort or have sudden dyspnea, pulmo-
nary edema, or ventricular arrhythmias as their initial presentation. There are no
specific physical findings in a patient with an acute MI. Many patients are anxious
and diaphoretic. Cardiac auscultation may reveal an S gallop, reflecting myocardial
4
noncompliance because of ischemia; an S gallop, representing severe systolic dys-
3
function; or a new apical systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation caused by isch-
emic papillary muscle dysfunction.
Electrocardiogram. The ECG is often critical in diagnosing an acute MI and guid-
ing therapy. A series of ECG changes reflects the evolution of the infarction
(Figure 3–2).
1. The earliest changes are tall, positive, hyperacute T waves in the ischemic vas-
cular territory.
2. This is followed by elevation of the ST segments (myocardial “injury pattern”).
3. Over hours to days, T-wave inversion frequently develops.
4. Finally, diminished R-wave amplitude or Q waves occurs, representing signifi-
cant myocardial necrosis and replacement by scar tissue.
When acute ischemia is limited to the subendocardium, ST-segment depression,
rather than ST-segment elevation, develops. ST-segment elevation indicates that the
full thickness of the wall has been affected (ie, “transmural” infarction).

From the ECG we can localize the ischemia related to a vascular territory sup-
plied by one of the three major coronary arteries. STEMI is defined as ST-segment
elevation more than 0.1 mV in two or more contiguous leads (ie, in the same vas-
cular territory) and/or a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) (which obscures
usual ST-segment analysis). As a general rule, leads II, III, and aVF correspond to
the inferior surface of the heart supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA); leads
V to V correspond to the anterior surface supplied by the left anterior descending
2 4
coronary artery (LAD); and leads I, aVL, V , and V correspond to the lateral sur-
5 6
face, supplied by the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX).
Cardiac Biomarkers. Certain proteins, referred to as cardiac biomarkers, are released
into blood from necrotic heart muscle after an acute MI. The creatine phos-
phokinase (CK) level rises within 4 to 8 hours and returns to normal by 48 to
72 hours. Creatine phosphokinase is found in skeletal muscle and other tissues, but
the CK-MB isoenzyme is not found in significant amounts outside of heart muscle,
so elevation of this fraction is more specific for myocardial injury. Cardiac-specific
04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 43 03/09/20 9:18 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,71,"44 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac-specific troponin T (cTnT) are more specific to heart
muscle and are the preferred markers of myocardial injury. These protein levels rise
approximately from 3 to 5 hours after infarct. The cTnI levels may remain elevated
for 7 to 10 days and cTnT levels for 10 to 14 days. They are very sensitive and fairly
specific indicators of myocardial injury, and their levels may be elevated with even
small amounts of myocardial necrosis. Generally, two sets of normal troponin levels
6 to 8 hours apart exclude MI.
Differential Diagnosis. The diagnosis of acute MI is made by finding at least two of
the following three features: typical chest pain persisting for more than 30 minutes,
typical ECG findings, and elevated cardiac biomarker levels. Because of the urgency
in initiating treatment, diagnosis often rests on the clinical history and the ECG
findings while determination of cardiac biomarker levels is pending. During the
initial evaluation, other conditions that present with chest pain but could impair
with the treatment of ACS should be excluded. Two such conditions are aortic dis-
section and acute pericarditis. Aortic dissection often presents with unequal pulses
or blood pressures in the arms, a new murmur of aortic insufficiency, or a widened
mediastinum on chest x-ray film. Acute pericarditis often presents with chest pain
and a pericardial friction rub, but the ECG findings show diffuse ST-segment eleva-
tion rather than those limited to a vascular territory.
Treatment
Once an acute MI has been diagnosed based on history, ECG, or cardiac biomark-
ers, several therapies are initiated. Because the process is caused by acute throm-
bosis, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and anticoagulation with heparin are used.
To limit infarct size, beta-blockers are used to decrease myocardial oxygen demand,
and nitrates are given to increase coronary blood flow. All of these therapies appear
to reduce mortality in patients with acute MI. In addition, morphine may be given
to reduce pain and the consequent tachycardia. Patients are also placed on supple-
mental oxygen (Figure 3–3). After this medical management, reperfusion therapy
should be considered. The major options are thrombolytics or PCI.
Percutaneous coronary intervention. PCI is effective in restoring perfusion in
patients with acute STEMI and, if performed by experienced operators in dedi-
cated medical centers, has been shown in multiple trials to provide a greater survival
benefit and lower risk for serious bleeding compared to thrombolytics. If patients
with an acute STEMI present within 2 to 3 hours of symptom onset and can receive
PCI within 90 minutes, then PCI is the recommended reperfusion therapy. PCI can
also be used in patients with a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy or who
are hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock, for whom thrombolytics offer no survival
benefit. PCI is accomplished by cardiac catheterization, in which a guidewire is
inserted into the occluded coronary artery and a small balloon threaded over the
guidewire and inflated in an attempt to open the blockage and restore blood flow.
Sometimes intraluminal expandable stents are deployed, which may improve vessel
patency. Use of primary PCI may be limited by the availability of the facilities and
personnel required to perform the procedure in a timely fashion.
Thrombolytics. If PCI is not available, patients with STEMI should receive
thrombolytics, which have been shown to reduce mortality and preserve

myocardial function. In patients without ST-segment elevation, thrombolytics
have not demonstrated the same mortality benefit. Because myocardium can be
salvaged only before it is irreversibly injured (“time is muscle”), patients benefit
maximally when the drug is given early (eg, within 1-3 hours after the onset of
chest pain), and the relative benefits decline with time. The major risk of throm-
bolytics is bleeding, which can lead to potentially disastrous situations, such as
intracranial hemorrhages. The risk of hemorrhage is relatively constant, so the
risk begins to outweigh the benefit by 12 hours, at which time most infarctions
are completed, and the at-risk myocardium is dead. Thrombolytic therapy is indi-
cated if all of the following criteria are met:
1. Clinical complaints are consistent with ischemic-type chest pain.
2. ST-segment elevation more than 1 mm is present in at least two anatomically
contiguous leads.
3. There are no contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.
4. Patient is younger than 75 years (greater risk of hemorrhage if > 75).
Contraindications to thrombolytics are related to the patient’s bleeding risk and
include recent major surgery, active internal bleeding, suspected aortic dissection,
severe hypertension, or a prior history of a hemorrhagic stroke.
Complications
In acute MI, mortality is usually a result of ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial
pump failure and resultant cardiogenic shock (Table 3–3).
Ventricular Arrhythmias. Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricu-
lar tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), are common, especially in the
first 24 hours. Historically, most deaths from acute MI occurred in the first hour
and were caused by VT/VF. This has diminished in recent years with earlier, more
aggressive treatment of ischemia and arrhythmias. Premature ventricular contrac-
tions (PVCs) are very common but generally not treated with antiarrhythmic
agents unless they occur very frequently, are sustained, or induce hemodynamic

compromise. Sustained VT (> 30 seconds) and VF are life threatening because
they prevent coordinated ventricular contraction, causing cardiovascular collapse.
They are treated with defibrillation, followed by infusion of intravenous antiar-
rhythmics such as amiodarone. Electrolyte deficiencies, such as hypokalemia or
hypomagnesemia, can potentiate ventricular arrhythmias and should be corrected.
One benign ventricular arrhythmia that is generally not suppressed by antiar-
rhythmics is the accelerated idioventricular rhythm. This is a wide-complex escape
rhythm between 60 and 110 bpm that frequently accompanies reperfusion of the
myocardium but causes no hemodynamic compromise.
Supraventricular and Atrial Tachyarrhythmias. Supraventricular or atrial tachyar-
rhythmias are much less common after acute MI, but they can worsen ischemia and
cause infarct extension as a consequence of the rate-related increase in myocardial
oxygen demand. When they cause hemodynamic instability, they also are treated
with immediate direct current (DC) cardioversion.
Bradyarrhythmias. Other frequent rhythm disturbances are bradyarrhythmias.
Sinus bradycardia is frequently seen in inferior MI because the RCA supplies the
sinoatrial node, but the condition generally requires no treatment unless it causes
hypotension. If the heart rate is slow enough to cause cardiac output and blood
pressure to fall, intravenous atropine is usually administered.
Bradyarrhythmias can also be caused by atrioventricular (AV) conduction dis-
turbances. First-degree AV block (PR interval prolongation) and Mobitz I second-
degree AV block (gradual prolongation of the PR interval before a nonconducted
P wave) are often caused by AV nodal dysfunction, for example, nodal ischemia
caused by inferior MI. Patients who are symptomatic can be treated with atropine.
Conduction Dysfunctions. Conduction disturbances below the AV node typically
produce a widened QRS complex. Examples include Mobitz II second-degree AV
block (nonconducted P waves not preceded by PR prolongation) and third-degree
AV block (complete AV dissociation with no P-wave conduction). Third-degree AV
block also can be caused by AV nodal dysfunction. These arrhythmias are described
more fully in other cases. Conduction disturbances caused by involvement of the
bundle of His include LBBB or right bundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior
hemiblock. Conduction disturbances below the AV node generally have a worse
prognosis than AV nodal dysfunction because they are generally seen with anterior
infarction in which a significant amount of myocardium is damaged. When symp-
tomatic bradycardias such as third-degree AV block develop, they may be treated
with external pacing but can require placement of a temporary transvenous pace-
maker if the patient is in cardiogenic shock from complete heart block. Patients in
persistent complete heart block will require placement of a permanent pacemaker.
Cardiac pump failure and cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock in acute MI usually
is the most severe form of LV pump failure, manifested by end-organ hypoperfu-
sion. Ischemic reduction in ventricular diastolic compliance may lead to transient
pulmonary congestion, associated with elevated left-sided filling pressures. Exten-
sive myocardial necrosis and less contracting heart muscle may cause systolic failure
and reduced cardiac output. Patients with hypotension frequently are evaluated by
04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 47 03/09/20 9:18 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,75,"48 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheterization to assess hemodynamic parame-
ters. Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed when the patient has hypotension with systolic
arterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg, markedly reduced cardiac index less than
1.8 L/min/m2, and elevated LV filling pressure (measured indirectly with a pulmo-
nary capillary wedge pressure > 18 mm Hg). Clinically, such patients appear hypo-
tensive, with cold extremities because of peripheral vasoconstriction, pulmonary
edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure, reflecting high left- and right-sided
filling pressures. Supportive treatment includes hemodynamic monitoring, ade-
quate ventilation and oxygenation, and blood pressure support with vasopressors
such as dobutamine and dopamine. These patients also may require mechanical
assistance to augment blood pressure while providing afterload reduction, using
intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Cardiogenic shock may require urgent revas-
cularization with primary PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery.
Hypotension may also be seen in patients with right ventricular (RV) infarction,
which is a complication of RCA occlusion and inferior infarction. In this case, LV
function is not impaired, but LV filling is dramatically reduced because of the right-
sided ventricular failure (the left heart can only pump out what it receives from the
right heart). These patients can be recognized clinically as hypotensive, with mark-
edly elevated jugular venous pressure but clear lung fields and no pulmonary edema
seen radiographically (in contrast to the pulmonary edema seen in patients with
hypotension to LV failure). The diagnosis is confirmed by observation of ST-
segment elevation in a right-sided ECG. In this setting, RV function is impaired
and highly dependent on adequate preload, so treatment consists of volume
replacement with crystalloid or colloid solution. Diuretics or nitrates should be
avoided in these patients because they lower preload, which can cause catastrophic
cardiovascular collapse. Patients with RV dysfunction or failure may require ino-
tropic support to increase blood delivery to the LV.
Mechanical Problems. A number of mechanical problems can complicate acute MI,
usually presenting within the first week with a new systolic murmur. The most
common is papillary muscle dysfunction caused by LV ischemia or infarction, lead-
ing to mitral regurgitation, which may or may not be hemodynamically significant.
This is in contrast with papillary muscle rupture, which produces a flail mitral
leaflet and acute mitral regurgitation with development of heart failure and car-
diogenic shock. Ventricular septal rupture can also occur, possibly leading to devel-
opment of acute heart failure and shock. Transthoracic echocardiography can be
used to distinguish among these conditions. In all of them, stabilization of cardio-
genic shock is accomplished using afterload reduction with intravenous nitroglyc-
erin or nitroprusside and sometimes with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation
until definitive, urgent, surgical repair can be accomplished. Other modalities of
mechanical circulatory support may be used for temporary support in cardiogenic
shock, including a LV assist device or venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO).
The most catastrophic mechanical complication is rupture of the ventricular
free wall. As blood fills the pericardium, cardiac tamponade develops rapidly, with
sudden pulselessness, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. This complication
nearly always is fatal.

Case Files Internal Medicine,76,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 49
Post-MI Risk Stratification. Post-MI, patients should be stratified to identify
patients who are at high risk for subsequent cardiac events and who might benefit
from revascularization. The initial evaluation involves noninvasive testing. Sub-
maximal exercise stress testing is generally performed in stable patients before hos-
pital discharge to detect residual ischemia or ventricular ectopy and to provide a
guideline for exercise in the early recovery period. Evaluation of LV systolic function,
usually with echocardiography, is routinely performed. High-risk patients include
those with impaired systolic function, large areas of ischemic myocardium on stress
testing, postinfarction angina, or ventricular ectopy. These patients might benefit
from coronary angiography to evaluate for revascularization. PCI can be performed
to reduce anginal symptoms, and coronary artery bypass surgery should be consid-
ered for patients with multivessel atherosclerotic stenosis and impaired systolic func-
tion because the surgery may reduce symptoms and prolong survival. Post-STEMI
patients with LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction [EF] < 40%) are at increased
risk for sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias and may benefit from
placement of an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
Secondary Prevention of Ischemic Heart Disease. Medical therapy to reduce modifi-
able risk factors is the cornerstone of post-MI care. In addition to symptom relief,
the major goal of medical therapy is to prevent cardiac events: fatal or nonfatal MI.
By far, the most important risk factor is smoking cessation. Quitting tobacco use can
reduce the risk of fatal or nonfatal cardiac events by more than 50%, more than any
other medical or surgical therapy available.
A number of other therapies reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events
and prolong survival in patients with coronary artery disease. Antiplatelet agents
such as aspirin and clopidogrel reduce the risk of thrombus formation. Beta-blockers
reduce myocardial oxygen demand and may help suppress ventricular arrhythmias.
Statins improve serum cholesterol levels and may stabilize vascular plaque, reduc-
ing the number of coronary events and prolonging survival. Angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors decrease ventricular remodeling and reduce mortality and
are recommended for all patients after STEMI. Aldosterone antagonists such as
spironolactone or eplerenone reduce mortality in patients with LV EF < 40% and
clinical heart failure or diabetes. Finally, screening for depression is appropriate, as
depression is common (∼20%) post-MI and has been associated with increased
rates of hospitalization and death.

ANSWERS
3.1 B. It is appropriate to evaluate chest pain to first rule out cardiac ischemia. One
of the most common causes of “chest pain,” particularly in a younger patient,
is gastroesophageal reflux or esophageal spasm. This patient has classic symp-
toms of reflux esophagitis and is best treated with a proton pump inhibitor.
If the chest pain has the characteristics of angina pectoris (retrosternal loca-
tion, precipitated by exertion, relieved by rest or nitroglycerin), it should be
investigated with a stress test (answer A) or coronary angiography (answer C).
SSRIs may be used to treat panic disorder, which can present with chest pain
and palpitations; however, there are no indications for an SSRI in this patient
(answer D).
3.2 B. Sinus bradycardia is often seen with inferior wall MI because the RCA sup-
plies the inferior wall of the LV and the sinoatrial node. The ischemic changes
in leads II, III, and aVF are in the region of the inferior leads. A circum-
flex-territory infarction (answer A) usually leads to a lateral wall infarction,
involving leads I, aVL, V , and V . LV aneurysm (answer C) can be a late com-
5 6
plication of MI, associated with persistence of ST elevation for weeks after
an MI. Anterior wall infarction (answer D) is associated with ST elevation in
leads V1 through V .
4
3.3 D. Diabetic patients can have myocardial ischemia or infarction with atypical
or absent symptoms. Clinical suspicion and a liberal use of cardiac enzyme
testing are required. Troponin levels often remain elevated for 7 to 10 days and
should not be used to diagnose reinfarction, especially if the levels are trending
downward. New ECG findings or rapidly rising markers such as serum myo-
globin or CK-MB can be used in this setting. Thrombolytics, PCI, or coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG) (answers A, B, and C) are not indicated in this
patient at this time, as her elevated troponins are likely due to prior infarct, and
she does not meet criteria for STEMI or NSTEMI currently.
3.4 C. Aspirin is the first agent that should be used after oxygen and nitroglycerin.
Aspirin use decreases mortality in the face of an acute coronary event. Because
initial ECGs and cardiac enzymes may be normal in an acute MI, serial studies
are needed to definitively rule out MI. Echocardiography or coronary angiog-
raphy (answers A and D) may be appropriate in working up this patient’s chest
pain, but the first priority is to administer aspirin. Stress tests (answer B) are
used to determine if patients with moderate pretest probability of coronary
artery disease have it or not. Stress tests are never part of the acute manage-
ment of cardiac chest pain. CABG (answer E) is premature in this patient, who
does not have any indications for the procedure at this time.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or acute MI) occur when a
»
thrombus forms at the site of rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and
acutely occludes a coronary artery.
Acute MI is diagnosed based on the presence of at least two of three
»
criteria: typical symptoms, ECG findings, and cardiac enzymes.
ECG findings can further stratify MI into STEMI or NSTEMI. Initial ECG and
»
enzyme levels may be normal, so serial studies are necessary.
Typical initial treatment of ACS includes aspirin, beta-blockers, nitrates,
»
heparin, and morphine. Nitrates and beta-blockers should be used cau-
tiously as they lower cardiac output.
Early reperfusion with PCI or thrombolytics reduces mortality and pre-
»
serves ventricular function in patients who have ST-segment elevation,
have no contraindications, and receive treatment within the first 6 to
12 hours.
The goal of secondary prevention after MI is to prevent recurrent cardiac
»
events and death. Smoking cessation, antiplatelet medications, beta-
blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and aldosterone antagonists all reduce
the rate of events and mortality.
After MI, PCI can be performed to reduce ischemia and anginal symp-
»
toms. Bypass surgery may be indicated for patients with multivessel ste-
nosis and impaired systolic function to reduce symptoms and prolong
survival.
The ECG can indicate the location of the ischemia or infarction: anterior
»
(leads V through V); lateral (leads I, aVL, V , and V); inferior (leads II, III,
2 4 5 6
and aVF); and posterior (R waves in leads V and V).

STEMI is characterized by ischemic discomfort along with ST-segment

A 72-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of worsening exertional
dyspnea. Previously, he had been able to work in his garden and mow the lawn,
but now he feels short of breath after walking 100 ft. He does not have chest pain
at rest but has experienced retrosternal chest pressure with strenuous exertion. He
occasionally feels light-headed while climbing a flight of stairs, as if he were about
to faint, but this resolves after sitting down. He now uses three pillows when he
sleeps; otherwise, he wakes up at night feeling short of breath, which is relieved
within minutes by sitting upright in bed. He notes occasional swelling of his lower
extremities. He denies any significant medical history, takes no medications, and
prides himself on the fact that he has not seen a doctor in years. He does not
smoke or drink alcohol.
On physical examination, he is afebrile, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute
(bpm), blood pressure of 115/92 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per
minute. Examination of the head and neck reveals a normal thyroid gland and
distended neck veins. Bibasilar inspiratory crackles are appreciated. On cardiac
examination, his heart rhythm is regular with a normal S and S, with an S at the
1 2 4
apex, a leftward displaced apical impulse, and a late-peaking systolic murmur at
the right upper sternal border that radiates to his carotids. The carotid upstrokes
have diminished amplitude.

ANSWERS TO CASE 4:
Heart Failure due to Critical Aortic Stenosis
Summary: A 72-year-old man presents with
Angina-like chest pressure with strenuous exertion and near-syncope while climbing

a flight of stairs
Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, pedal edema, elevated jugular venous

pressure (JVP), and crackles suggesting pulmonary edema
A late systolic murmur radiating to his carotids, the paradoxical splitting of his second

heart sound, and the diminished carotid upstrokes suggesting severe aortic stenosis
Most likely diagnosis: Heart failure (HF), likely as a result of aortic valve stenosis.
Diagnostic test: Echocardiogram to assess the aortic valve area as well as the left
ventricular (LV) systolic function, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the causes of chronic HF (eg, ischemia, hypertension, valvular disease,
alcohol abuse, cocaine, and thyrotoxicosis). (EPA 1, 3)
2. Understand the treatment of acute and chronic HF. (EPA 4)
3. Discuss the evaluation of aortic stenosis and the indications for valve replace-
ment. (EPA 1, 4, 7)
4. Identify preventive measures for general patients at risk for heart failure (HF)
to avoid progression. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This is an elderly patient with symptoms and signs of aortic stenosis. The valvular
disorder has progressed from previous angina and presyncopal symptoms to HF,
reflecting worsening severity of the stenosis and worsening prognosis for survival.
This patient should undergo urgent evaluation of his aortic valve surface area and
coronary artery status to assess the need for valve replacement.

APPROACH TO:
Heart Failure
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE HF: Acute (hours, days) presentation of cardiac decompensation with
pulmonary edema and low cardiac output, which may proceed to cardiogenic
shock; can be superimposed onto chronic HF.
CARDIAC REMODELING: Changes to cardiac myocytes due to changing car-
diac parameters leading to cardiac dysfunction. Some medications can prevent or
even reverse the remodeling.
CHRONIC HF: Chronic (months, years) presence of cardiac dysfunction; symp-
toms may range from minimal to severe.
DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: Increased diastolic filling pressures caused by
impaired diastolic relaxation and decreased ventricular compliance, but with pre-
served ejection fraction (EF) > 40% to 50%. Etiologies may include uncontrolled
hypertension, constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and cardiac
tamponade, among others.
LEFT-SIDED HF: HF due to left ventricular dysfunction; also known as “forward” HF.
RIGHT-SIDED HF: HF due to right ventricular dysfunction; also known as
“backward” HF.
SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: Low cardiac output caused by impaired systolic
function (low EF < 40%). Etiologies may include myocardial infarction, myocar-
ditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy resulting from multiple diseases, among others.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO HEART FAILURE
Pathophysiology
Heart failure is found in 1% to 2% of the US population, with disproportionately
higher rates in African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics. HF is a clinical
syndrome that is produced when the heart is unable to meet the metabolic needs of
the body while maintaining normal ventricular filling pressures. A series of neurohu-
moral responses develops, including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
axis and increased sympathetic activity, which initially may be compensatory but
ultimately cause further cardiac decompensation. The most common cause of HF
overall is ischemic cardiomyopathy. Systolic dysfunction is classified via transthoracic
echocardiogram (TTE) by reduction of contractility (reduction in EF), in contrast to
diastolic dysfunction, in which EF is preserved.
Clinical Presentation
Types of HF. Symptoms may be a result of forward failure (low cardiac output or
systolic dysfunction), including fatigue, lethargy, and even hypotension, or backward
failure (increased filling pressures or diastolic dysfunction), including dyspnea,
05_Toy-IM_Case04_p055-064.indd 57 03/09/20 9:17 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,85,"58 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
peripheral edema, and ascites. Some patients have isolated diastolic dysfunction
with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF > 40%-50%), most often
as a consequence of hypertension or simply of aging. Half of patients with HF
have impaired systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) with associated increased filling
pressures. Some patients have isolated right-sided HF, which typically presents pre-
dominantly with symptoms of peripheral congestion. These include pitting edema
of extremities, hepatomegaly and congestion, ascites, and jugular venous disten-
tion. On the other hand, left-sided HF, which often progresses to biventricular fail-
ure, exhibits pulmonary symptoms before progressing to signs of peripheral volume
overload. These include pulmonary edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthop-
nea, and cardiac asthma.
History and Physical Examination. Obtaining a thorough history and physical
examination is critical in the evaluation of possible HF. A history should focus on
exertional symptoms and triggers, alcohol and drug use, and recent viral infections.
Physical exam should involve assessment for rales, displaced apical impulse, JVP,
hepatojugular reflux, hepatomegaly, and extremity pitting edema. The presence of
pulmonary edema more likely supports a diagnosis of left HF. Auscultatory find-
ings may include an S (atrial gallop) or an S (ventricular gallop), low-pitched heart
4 3
sound that is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope.
Diagnostic Workup. Workup should include an ECG, chest x-ray, TTE, and BNP
levels. An ECG may reveal ventricular hypertrophy or previous myocardial infarc-
tion. Chest x-ray may show signs of pulmonary congestion, cardiomegaly, and other
lung pathology. An echocardiogram is useful for assessment of EF, wall motion
abnormalities, valvular disease, and possible pericardial fluid collection. BNP levels
can be used to support clinical suspicion for HF. BNP values > 400 pg/mL are rela-
tively sensitive for HF. Other appropriate investigations may include cardiac stress
testing or coronary angiography if there are signs of myocardial ischemia.
Staging. HF is a chronic and progressive syndrome that can be assessed by following
the patient’s exercise tolerance, as done by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
functional classification (Table 4–1). This functional classification carries prognos-
tic significance. Individuals in class III who have low oxygen consumption during
exercise have an annual mortality rate of 20%; in class IV, the rate is 60% annually.
Patients with a low ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 20%) also have very high
mortality risks. Death associated with HF may occur from the underlying disease
process, cardiogenic shock, or sudden death as a result of ventricular arrhythmias.
Chronic Heart Failure Treatment
Although HF has many causes (Table 4–2), identification of the underlying
treatable or reversible causes of disease is essential. For example, HF related to
Table 4–1 • NEW YORK HEART ASSOCATION FUNCTIONAL
CLASSIFICATION
Class I: No limitation during ordinary physical activity
Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Develops fatigue or dyspnea with moderate exertion
Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Even light activity produces symptoms
Class IV: Symptoms at rest. Any activity causes worsening

tachycardia, alcohol consumption, or viral myocarditis may be reversible with
removal of the inciting factor. In patients with underlying multivessel atheroscle-
rotic coronary disease and a low EF, revascularization with coronary artery bypass
grafting improves cardiac function and prolongs survival. The three major treat-
ment goals for patients with chronic HF are relief of symptoms, prevention of dis-
ease progression, and a reduction in mortality risk.
Relief of Symptoms. The HF symptoms, which are mainly caused by low car-
diac output and fluid overload, usually are relieved with lifestyle modifications and
diuretics. Lifestyle changes may include reducing sodium intake to < 3 g daily, fluid
restriction, establishing an exercise regimen, smoking cessation, and reduction of
alcohol intake.
Preventing Disease Progression. Because HF has such a substantial mortality,
measures to halt or reverse disease progression are necessary. Reversible causes
should be aggressively sought and treated.
Decreasing Mortality Risk. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibi-
tors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and some beta-blockers, such as
carvedilol (CAR), metoprolol, or bisoprolol, have been shown to reduce mortality
in patients with impaired systolic function and moderate-to-severe symptoms. In
patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition (or in black patients in whom ACE
inhibitors appear to confer less benefit), the use of hydralazine with nitrates has
been shown to decrease mortality. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone
may be added to patients with NYHA class III or IV HF with persistent symptoms,
but patients should be monitored for hyperkalemia. Digoxin can be added to these
regimens for persistent symptoms, but it provides no survival benefit and can con-
fer significant toxicity at supratherapeutic levels. The mechanisms of these various
agents are outlined in Table 4–3. On the other hand, there are certain medica-
tions that are relatively contraindicated in HF; some examples include the nondi-
hydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem), which reduce

Case Files Internal Medicine,87,"60 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Table 4–3 • SELECTED MEDICATIONS FOR HF
Medication Mechanism of Action
Beta-blockers Prevent and reverse adrenergically mediated intrinsic myocardial
dysfunction and remodeling.
ACE inhibitors/ARBs Reduce preload and afterload, thereby reducing right atrial,
pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures
along with systemic vascular resistance. Prevent remodeling.
These agents are the initial drugs of choices in treating HF due to
survival advantage.
Nitrates and nitrites Reduce preload and clear pulmonary congestion. Decreases
mortality in HF when associated with hydralazine.
Hydralazine Unclear. Vasodilator.
Diuretics Decrease preload. Especially useful in acute settings.
Digoxin Improves cardiac contractility. Also slows conduction at
atrioventricular (AV) node. It has a narrow therapeutic window.
Aldosterone antagonists Block the action of aldosterone. Spironolactone has antiandrogenic
effects, while eplerenone does not.
cardiac contractility, and the thiazolidinediones, a class of diabetes medications that
can exacerbate HF.
Some devices may also be useful in reducing symptoms and mortality in patients
with HF. Patients with depressed EF and advanced symptoms often have a wid-
ened QRS > 120 ms, indicating dyssynchronous ventricular contraction. Place-
ment of a biventricular pacemaker, called cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT),
to stimulate both ventricles to contract simultaneously can improve symptoms and
reduce mortality. Since patients with class II–III HF and depressed EF < 35% have
elevated risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias, placement of
an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) should be considered.
Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Treatment
In patients with acute decompensated HF, the initial treatment goals are to stabilize
the patient’s hemodynamic derangements and to identify and treat reversible factors
that may have precipitated the decompensation, such as arrhythmias or myocar-
dial ischemia. Symptomatic treatment may include the use of oxygen, nitrates, and
furosemide.
Regarding hemodynamics, if patients appear to have elevated LV filling pres-
sures, they often require intravenous vasodilators such as nitroglycerin infusion,
and patients with decreased cardiac output may require inotropes such as dobuta-
mine; hypotensive patients may require vasoconstrictors such as dopamine.
Another complication that may arise is cardiorenal syndrome, a process that
results from reductions in glomerular filtration rate due to renal hypoperfusion
and renal venous congestion. Management includes treatment of the underlying
HF and acute kidney injury.

Case Files Internal Medicine,88,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 61
CLINICAL APPROACH TO AORTIC STENOSIS
Pathophysiology
The history and physical findings presented in the scenario suggest that this
patient’s HF may be a result of aortic stenosis. This is the most common symp-
tomatic valvular abnormality in adults. Most cases occur in men. The causes of the
valvular stenosis vary depending on the typical age of presentation: Stenosis in
patients younger than 30 years usually is caused by a congenital bicuspid valve; in
patients 30 to 70 years old, it usually is caused by congenital stenosis or acquired
rheumatic heart disease; and in patients older than 70 years, it usually is caused by
degenerative calcific stenosis.
Clinical Presentation
Typical physical findings of critical aortic stenosis include a narrow pulse pressure, a
soft S, a harsh late-peaking systolic murmur heard best at the right second intercos-
2
tal space with radiation to the carotid arteries, and a delayed, slow-rising carotid
upstroke (pulsus parvus et tardus). The ECG often shows LV hypertrophy. Doppler
echocardiography reveals a thickened abnormal valve and can estimate aortic valve
area and the transvalvular pressure gradient to determine severity. As the valve orifice
narrows, the pressure gradient increases in an attempt to maintain cardiac output.
Severe aortic stenosis is defined as a calcified valve with decreased systolic opening, an
aortic velocity > 4 m/s, and a mean pressure gradient > 40 mg Hg; valve areas are typi-
cally less than 1 cm2 (normal 3–4 cm2).
Symptoms of aortic stenosis develop as a consequence of LV hypertrophy as
well as diminished cardiac output from flow-limiting valvular stenosis. The first
symptom typically is angina pectoris, that is, retrosternal chest pain precipitated
by exercise and relieved by rest. As the stenosis worsens and cardiac output falls,
patients may experience syncopal episodes, typically precipitated by exertion.
Finally, because of the low cardiac output and high diastolic filling pressures,
patients develop clinically apparent HF as described previously. The prognosis for
patients worsens as symptoms develop. The mean survival with angina, syncope, or
HF is 5 years, 3 years, and 2 years, respectively.
Treatment
Patients with severe stenosis who are symptomatic or have a LVEF < 50% should be
considered for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Indications for AVR are outlined
in Table 4–4. Preoperative cardiac catheterization is routinely performed to pro-
vide definitive assessment of the aortic valve area and the pressure gradient, as well
as to assess the coronary arteries for significant stenosis. There are three primary
approaches to AVR: surgery, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and
catheter balloon valvuloplasty. In patients who are not good candidates for valve
replacement, the stenotic valve can be enlarged using balloon valvuloplasty, but this
will provide only temporary relief of symptoms, as there is a high rate of resteno-
sis. TAVR is a new technique that has been developed for patients who have an
unacceptably high surgical risk, and catheter-based aortic valves have now been
approved for use in both Europe and the United States.

Because the most common cause of HF is ischemic cardiomyopathy, the impor-
tance of preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of progressive cardiac dys-
function cannot be overstated. Primary prevention includes modification of risk
factors: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, poor dietary habits, physical activ-
ity, alcohol intake, and smoking. Maintaining an effective regimen for hypertension
is critical to prevention of diastolic dysfunction, as uncontrolled hypertension can
progress to concentric hypertrophy and diastolic failure. Elevated low-density lipo-
protein levels > 190 mg/dL or a 10-year atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease
(ASCVD) risk of > 7.5% should prompt the initiation of high-intensity statin
therapy. Patients with diabetes should be on a regimen that aims to maintain a
hemoglobin A between 7% and 8% while balancing the risk of hypoglycemia.
1C
Dietary changes should include reduction of salt intake and red meats with an
increase in vegetables and whole grains. Adherence to an exercise regimen that
includes 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly is recom-
mended. Reduction of alcohol intake and smoking cessation are also beneficial risk
management strategies.

he is noted to have an EF of 50%. Which of the following is the most accurate
description of this patient’s condition?
A. Diastolic dysfunction (HF with preserved EF)
B. Systolic dysfunction (HF with reduced EF)
C. Dilated cardiomyopathy
D. Pericardial disease
ANSWERS
4.1 A. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers decrease the risk of mortality for patients
who have HF with impaired systolic function. For this reason, these agents are
the initial therapies of choice to treat HF. They both prevent and can even, in
some circumstances, reverse cardiac remodeling.
4.2 B. In the United States, the most common cause of HF associated with
impaired systolic function is ischemic cardiomyopathy due to coronary
atherosclerosis.
4.3 C. The symptoms of aortic stenosis classically progress through angina,
syncope, and, finally, HF, which has the worst prognosis for survival. This
patient’s systolic murmur is consistent with aortic stenosis. An evaluation
should include echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and then AVR. The
patient meets criteria for valve replacement because he is exhibiting symptoms.
4.4 A. When the EF is 50%, there is likely diastolic dysfunction with stiff ventricles.
The stiff, thickened ventricles do not accept blood very readily. This patient has
symptoms with mild exertion that are indicative of functional class III. The
worst class is level IV, manifested as symptoms at rest or with minimal
05_Toy-IM_Case04_p055-064.indd 63 03/09/20 9:17 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,91,"64 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
exertion. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta-blockers are important agents in
patients with diastolic dysfunction. The current nomenclature uses the terms
preserved and reduced EF to replace diastolic and systolic HF, respectively.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that is always caused by some under-
»
lying heart disease, most commonly ischemic cardiomyopathy as a result
of atherosclerotic coronary disease, or hypertension.
HF can be caused by impaired systolic function (EF < 40%) or impaired

diastolic function (with preserved systolic function).
Chronic HF is a progressive disease with a high mortality. A patient’s
»
functional class (exercise tolerance) is the best predictor of mortality and
often guides therapy.
The primary goals of therapy are to relieve congestive symptoms with

salt restriction, diuretics, and vasodilators.
ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists can decrease

mortality in patients with HF.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy and placement of an ICD can reduce

symptoms and improve mortality in patients with advanced HF and low
EF < 35%.
Aortic stenosis produces progressive symptoms such as angina, exer-
»
tional syncope, and HF, with increasingly higher risk of mortality. Valve
replacement should be considered for patients with severe aortic steno-
sis who exhibit symptoms or have an LVEF < 50%.

A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance
after a sudden onset of severe retrosternal chest pain that began one hour ago
while he was at home mowing the lawn. He initially described the pain as a
tearing sensation that is now sharp, constant, referred to his back, and unrelated
to movement. Three doses of sublingual nitroglycerin administered by the
paramedics while en route to the hospital did not relieve the pain. He has never
had symptoms like this before. His only medical history is hypertension, for which
he takes enalapril. There is no cardiac disease in his family. He does not smoke,
drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He is a basketball coach at a local high school and
is usually very physically active.
On physical examination, he is a tall man with long extremities, appearing
uncomfortable and diaphoretic while lying on the stretcher with his eyes closed.
He is afebrile, with a heart rate of 118 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure
of 156/64 mm Hg in the right arm and 188/74 mm Hg in the left arm. His head and
neck examinations are unremarkable. His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally,
and an incidental note is made of pectus excavatum. His heart rate is tachycardic
and regular. A soft, early diastolic murmur is auscultated at the right sternal border
with bounding pulses. His abdominal examination is benign, and neurologic
examination is nonfocal. His chest x-ray shows a widened mediastinum.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the clinical and radiographic features of aortic dissection as well as
complications of dissection. (EPA 3)
2. Identify the risk factors for aortic dissection. (EPA 1, 2, 7)
3. Identify common genetic syndromes associated with aortic dissection.
(EPA 2, 12)
4. Understand the management of dissection and the indications for surgical
versus medical treatment. (EPA 4, 10)
5. Recognize other aortic diseases, such as abdominal aortic aneurysm
(AAA), and the role of surveillance and indications for surgical repair.
(EPA 1, 4, 7, 10)
Considerations
Most patients with chest pain seek medical attention because of the concern about
myocardial infarction (MI). Differentiating other conditions of chest pain is impor-
tant because some underlying conditions, such as aortic dissection, could be wors-
ened by an MI treatment algorithm, for example, by anticoagulation with heparin
or use of thrombolytics. In hypertensive patients with dissection, urgent blood
pressure lowering is indicated to limit propagation of the dissection.
The aorta is the largest conductance vessel in the body. It receives most of the
shear forces generated by the heart with every heartbeat throughout the lifetime
of an individual. The wall of the aorta is composed of three layers the intima, the
:
media, and the adventitia. These specialized layers allow the aortic wall to distend
under the great pressure created by every heartbeat. The vessel walls expand and
accommodate the forward flow of blood ejected from the heart during each cardiac

cycle, thus storing kinetic energy as potential energy and creating large amounts of
tensile stress. Pathologic processes arise when the vessel wall is unable to accom-
modate this tension.
APPROACH TO:
Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection
DEFINITIONS
AORTIC ANEURYSM: Defined as a pathologic dilation of more than 1.5 times
the normal diameter of the aorta. Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the thoracic
or abdominal aorta, but the large majority occur in the abdomen, below the renal
arteries and above the bifurcation of the iliac vessels.
AORTIC DISSECTION: Tear or ulceration of the aortic intima that allows pulsatile
aortic flow to dissect longitudinally along elastic planes of the media, creating a
false lumen or channel for blood flow.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO AORTIC DISSECTION
Epidemiology
Cystic degeneration of the elastic media predisposes patients to aortic dissec-
tion. This occurs in various connective tissue disorders that cause cystic medial
degeneration, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Exam-
ine for characteristic features of Marfan, including tall stature, long extremities,
joint hypermobility, pectus deformity, and scoliosis. Other genetic syndromes and
gene mutations may accelerate development of aneurysms and dissection and are
described in Table 5–1.
Other factors predisposing to aortic dissection are hypertension, aortic val-
vular abnormalities such as aortic stenosis and congenital bicuspid aortic valve,
coarctation of the aorta, the third trimester of pregnancy, atherosclerotic disease,
vasculitis, amphetamines/cocaine, and trauma. Aortic dissection may also occur
iatrogenically after cardiac surgery or catheterization. More recently, the use of
fluoroquinolones has been associated with an increased risk of aneurysm and dis-
section; care should be taken to choose alternative antibiotic regimens, if possible.
Causes are outlined in Table 5–2.
Pathophysiology
A dissection occurs when there is a sudden intimal tear or rupture followed by
the formation of a dissecting hematoma within the aortic media, separating the
intima from the adventitia and propagating distally. The presence of hypertension
and associated shear forces is the most important factor causing propagation of the
dissection. Aortic dissection can produce several devastating or fatal complications.
It can produce an intraluminal intimal flap, which can occlude branch arteries and
cause organ ischemia or infarction. The hematoma may rupture into the pericar-
dial sac, causing cardiac tamponade, or into the pleural space, causing hemothorax

and/or exsanguination. It can produce severe acute aortic regurgitation, leading to
fulminant heart failure.
Clinical Presentation
Clinical features typically include a sudden onset of ripping or tearing chest pain,
radiating to the back. However, the pain may radiate to the neck or extremities
as the dissection extends (Table 5–3). Differentiating the pain of dissection from
the pain of myocardial ischemia or infarction is essential because the use of anti-
coagulation or thrombolytics in a patient with a dissection may be devastating. In
contrast to anginal pain, which often builds over minutes, the pain of dissection is
often maximal at onset. In addition, myocardial ischemia pain is usually relieved by
nitrates, whereas the pain of dissection is not. Also, because most dissections begin
very close to the aortic valve, a dissection may produce an early diastolic murmur
characteristic of aortic insufficiency. If it occludes aortic branch arteries, such as the
brachiocephalic artery, it can produce dramatically different pulses and blood pres-
sures in the extremities. Most patients with dissection are hypertensive; if hypoten-
sion is present, one must suspect aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, or dissection
of the subclavian artery supplying the arm where the blood pressure is being mea-
sured. Often, a widened superior mediastinum (> 8 cm) is noted on plain chest film
because of dissection of the ascending aorta.
Diagnostic Approach. When aortic dissection is suspected, confirming the diag-
nosis with an imaging study is essential. Conventional aortography was the tra-
ditional diagnostic “gold standard,” but in recent years, very sensitive noninvasive
studies, such as TEE, dynamic CT scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), have gained widespread use. Because of the emergent nature of the condi-
tion, the best initial study is the one that can be obtained and interpreted quickly
in the given hospital setting. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable or has renal
insufficiency, TEE is the best test. Otherwise, CT angiography is widely used.
Classification. Several classification schemes describe the different types of aor-
tic dissections. Figure 5–1 shows the Stanford classification. Type A dissection

always involves the ascending aorta but may extend to any other part. Type B dis-
section does not involve the ascending aorta. The alternative method of classifica-
tion, the DeBakey classification scheme, splits type A dissections into types 1 and 2
and splits type B dissections into types 3a and 3b.
Treatment
Two-thirds of aortic dissections originate in the ascending aorta only centimeters
above the aortic valve. The classification system is important because it guides
therapy. Virtually all type A (proximal or ascending) dissections require urgent surgi-
cal therapy with replacement of the involved aorta and sometimes the aortic valve.
Without surgery, the mortality rate for type A dissections is 90%. Type B dissec-
tions do not involve the ascending aorta and typically originate in the aortic arch
distal to the left subclavian artery. Usually, type B dissections are first managed
medically, with surgery reserved only for complications such as rupture or ischemia
caused by occlusion of an aortic branch.
The aim of medical therapy is to prevent propagation of the dissection by reduc-
ing mean arterial pressure and the rate of rise (dP/dT) of arterial pressure, which
correlates with arterial shear forces. Beta-blockers (ie, metoprolol, esmolol, labetalol)
are used as first-line treatment to lower systolic blood pressure to < 120 mm Hg and
achieve a heart rate of 60 bpm, ultimately reducing shear forces. If hypertension is
refractory, sodium nitroprusside may be used; it is generally not used initially due
to risks of causing cyanide toxicity, especially in patients with renal insufficiency.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS
Epidemiology
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are found in 1.5% to 3% of older adults but in 5%
to 10% of higher risk patients, such as those with known atherosclerotic disease.
AAA is a degenerative condition typically found in older white men (> 50 years),
most commonly in smokers, who often have atherosclerotic disease elsewhere, such
as coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease. Smoking has been found
to be the most significant risk factor for the development of AAAs. Thus, it is recom-
mended that men between the ages of 65 and 75 who have a history of smoking should
be screened for AAA with ultrasound.
Pathophysiology
In marked contrast to the dramatic presentation of dissection of the thoracic aorta,
patients with AAA are typically asymptomatic; AAAs are often found by physi-
cal examination with detection of a midline pulsatile mass and auscultation of an
abdominal bruit or noted incidentally on imaging (ie, ultrasound). AAA is usually
defined as a dilation of the aorta with a diameter greater than 3 cm, typically below
the renal vasculature and above the bifurcation of the common iliacs.
One complication of AAAs is atheroembolic disease—small thrombi may form
within the aneurysm due to turbulent blood flow and can embolize to extremities,
leading to signs of distal ischemia. Findings can range from blue toe syndrome to
livedo reticularis. However, the feared complication of AAA is spontaneous rup-
ture, which can be visualized with ultrasound or contrast CT. If AAA ruptures
anteriorly into the peritoneal cavity, the patient usually exsanguinates and dies
within minutes. If AAA ruptures posteriorly and the bleeding is confined to the
retroperitoneum, the peritoneum can produce local tamponade, and the patient
will present with severe lower back or midabdominal pain. Skin findings of rupture
may include Grey Turner sign, which is ecchymosis of the flank, and Cullen sign,
which is periumbilical ecchymosis. Overall, the mortality rate of ruptured AAA is
80%, with 50% of patients dying before they reach the hospital. The risk of rupture
is related to the size of the aneurysm The annual rate of rupture is low if the aneu-
:
rysm is smaller than 5 cm but is at least 10% to 20% for 6-cm aneurysms.
Treatment
The risk of rupture must be weighed against the surgical risk of elective repair,
which traditionally requires excision of the diseased aorta and replacement with a
Dacron graft, although endovascular treatment with placement of an aortic stent
graft is now commonly performed. Operative repair of AAAs is indicated for aneu-
rysms 5.5 cm or greater in diameter, aneurysms expanding more than 1 cm per
year, or symptomatic aneurysms. Postoperative complications may include bowel
ischemia, infection, and rarely, aorto-enteric fistula. As for surveillance of AAAs,
the current recommendations are that patients undergo some sort of imaging of
the aneurysm (MRI, CT scan, or ultrasound study) at 6-month to 3-year inter-
vals, depending on the risk of rupture. Surveillance guidelines are outlined in
Table 5–4.

5.4 A 45-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and
hypertension has smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for the past 15 years and
drinks four glasses of wine every weekend. He is found to have an AAA inci-
dentally on CT imaging of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most
important predisposing factor for the development of his AAA?
A. Hypertension
B. Smoking
C. Hyperlipidemia
D. Alcohol use
ANSWERS
5.1 B. This clinical presentation of severe chest pain radiating to the back, unequal
brachial blood pressures or pulse strengths, and a widened mediastinum on
chest x-ray is consistent with acute aortic dissection. A CT scan of the chest
is a quick imaging test to confirm the aortic dissection. Thrombolytic therapy
(answer A) or anticoagulation (answer C) can worsen the process. Measur-
ing serial cardiac enzyme levels (answer D) would only delay the therapy and
endanger the patient.
5.2 C. Surgery is urgently required in the event of aortic root or other proximal
(type A) dissections. An unrecognized, and hence untreated, aortic dissection
can quickly lead to exsanguination and death. Medical therapy such as beta-
blockers (answer A) can help to decrease the risk of dissection while getting
the patient urgently to the operating room, but a type A dissection should not
merely be monitored since it has a very high mortality rate without surgery.
Angioplasty (answer B) may be indicated in a case of MI, but not in aortic
dissection. Anticoagulation (answer D) is not appropriate in this scenario.
5.3 B. When an AAA reaches 5.5 cm or greater, surgery (answer A) is usually
required because of the high risk of aneurysm rupture. For asymptomatic
aneurysms smaller than 5 cm, the 5-year risk of rupture is less than 1% to
2%, so serial noninvasive monitoring is an alternative strategy. Further imag-
ing such as with CT or MRI (answer C) is not warranted with the ultrasound
diameter being less than the threshold. Answer D (beta-agonist therapy) is
indicated when there is aortic dissection, to prepare for intervention, but not
in this patient with an indolent and chronic AAA.
5.4 B. Risk factors for AAA include smoking, hypertension (answer A), and
peripheral vascular disease. However, the single greatest risk factor for devel-
oping AAA is smoking history. Thus, it is recommended that all men with
a history of smoking undergo a one-time screening for AAA between the
ages of 65 and 75. Although hyperlipidemia (answer C) and alcohol use
(answer D) are risk factors for the development of AAA, these factors are not
as strongly associated with AAA as smoking.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Hypertension is an underlying factor that predisposes to aortic dissec-
»
tion in most cases. Other patients at risk include those with Marfan syn-
drome, patients with congenital aortic anomalies, or otherwise normal
women in the third trimester of pregnancy.
Chest pain in the presence of a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray

should suggest aortic dissection.
Medical therapy for aortic dissection includes intravenous beta-blockers
»
such as metoprolol, esmolol, or labetalol to lower cardiac contractil-
ity, arterial pressure, and shear stress, thus limiting propagation of the
dissection.
Urgent surgical repair is indicated for type A (ascending) aortic dissec-
»
tions. Uncomplicated, stable, type B (transverse or descending) aortic dis-
sections can be managed medically.
Aortic dissection may be complicated by rupture, occlusion of any branch
»
artery of the aorta, or retrograde dissection with hemopericardium and
cardiac tamponade.
Men between the ages of 65 and 75 with a smoking history should be
»
screened for AAA by ultrasound.
The risk of rupture of AAAs increases with size. Aneurysms larger than
»
5.5 cm should undergo elective surgical repair; those smaller than 5.5 cm
can be monitored with serial ultrasonography.

A 56-year-old man comes into your clinic as a new patient. Seven years ago at
a work-related health screening, he was diagnosed with hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia. At that time, he saw a physician who prescribed a diuretic
and encouraged him to lose weight, modify his diet, and exercise. Since that
time, he has not followed up with any clinician. Last month, a routine optometry
examination showed hypertensive retinopathy, and he was instructed to follow
up with a physician. He brings the optometry report to this visit, which describes
arteriovenous crossing defects and increased arteriolar light reflex. He denies
chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and has done so since he was
15 years old. He typically drinks two glasses of wine with dinner. On examination,
the patient is obese; you calculate his body mass index (BMI) as 30 kg/m2. His
blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg in the right arm and 170/94 mm Hg in the left
arm, and his heart rate is 84 beats per minute (bpm). He has no thyromegaly or
carotid bruits. Cardiac examination reveals an S gallop. No cardiac murmurs are

Summary: A 56-year-old man is being evaluated as a new patient with
Blood pressure of 168/98 mm Hg in the right arm and 170/94 mm Hg in the left arm

Fundoscopic examination revealing hypertensive retinopathy

Cardiac fourth heart sound, consistent with a thickened, noncompliant ventricle

Multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including his age, obesity, and smoking

Most likely diagnosis: Stage 2 hypertension with end-organ damage (left ventricular
hypertrophy and hypertensive retinopathy).
Next steps:
1. Use laboratory evaluation and a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess
for end-organ damage.
2. Assess patient’s overall cardiovascular risk status, including lipid profile.
3. Rule out secondary causes of hypertension.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Underline the initial evaluation of a patient with hypertension. (EPA 1, 3)
2. List the most common antihypertensive medications and their indications and
cautions regarding their usage. (EPA 4, 12)
3. Describe the various causes of secondary hypertension and when to pursue
these diagnoses. (EPA 2, 3)
Considerations
This is a 56-year-old man with severe hypertension who has physical examination
evidence of hypertensive end-organ damage (hypertensive retinopathy and left ven-
tricular hypertrophy). He has multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. The
most likely diagnosis is essential hypertension, but secondary causes still must be
considered. Although you have measured his blood pressure only once in your clinic,
he has been told before that he is hypertensive, and he already appears to have end-
organ damage of hypertension. His blood pressure is above 160 mm Hg systolic or
100 mm Hg diastolic which places him in stage 2 hypertension. He should be started
on two-drug therapy without further delay.

Hypertension
DEFINITIONS
DIEATRY APPROACHES TO STOP HYPERTENSION (DASH) DIET: Diet
rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dietary products and low in snacks,
sweets, meat, and saturated fat, with an emphasis of a sodium intake lower than
2300 mg/d.
ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE: Systolic blood pressures 120 to 129 mm Hg and
diastolic < 80 mm Hg.
ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION: Elevated blood pressure without a known cause,
also called primary or idiopathic hypertension. It comprises approximately 80% to
95% of all cases of hypertension.
LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION: A cornerstone in the treatment of hypertension,
consisting of regular aerobic activity, weight loss, decreased salt intake, and adher-
ence to a DASH–type dietary plan. Alcohol consumption should be moderated, no
more than two glasses of wine per day for men and one glass per day for women.
SECONDARY HYPERTENSION: Elevated blood pressure with a known under-
lying cause, such as renal artery stenosis or primary aldosteronism. Prevalence is
approximately 5% to 20% of all cases of hypertension.
STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION: Blood pressures 130–139/80–89 mm Hg.
STAGE 2 HYPERTENSION: Blood pressures equal to or greater than
140/90 mm Hg.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Background and Epidemiology
Hypertension is not diagnosed based on one blood pressure measurement. In gen-
eral, a diagnosis of hypertension requires repeatedly elevated measurements, ideally
including measurements outside of the clinic setting. This can involve the patient
checking their blood pressures at home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
(ABPM). ABPM consists of sending a patient home with an automated blood pres-
sure cuff that measures over a 24-hour period. Either of these methods gives a
more accurate measurement of a patient’s overall blood pressure than clinic read-
ings alone.
One well-described phenomenon is “white coat hypertension,” in which patients
have elevated blood pressures in the clinic, but normal blood pressures by ABPM
or home measurement. The clinical significance and treatment goals for white
coat hypertension are currently unclear. The inverse of white coat hypertension is
“masked hypertension,” in which a patient has normal clinic blood pressures but
elevated measurements on ABPM or home measurement. These patients have

an elevated risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and should be treated
despite normal clinic measurements.
Cardiovascular risk factors and hypertensive target organ damage should be iden-
tified. The major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are age, cigarette
smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, kidney disease, and a family history
of premature CVD.
Pathophysiology
Underlying causes of hypertension must then be considered. Essential or idiopathic
hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, comprising 80% to 95%
of cases, but approximately 5% to 20% of cases of hypertension have secondary
causes (Table 6–1). To identify the secondary (and potentially reversible) causes of
hypertension, the clinician must be aware of the clinical and laboratory manifesta-
tions of the processes. A secondary cause of hypertension should be suspected and
worked up when patients have any of the following clinical features: age of onset
before 25 or after 55, presentation with evidence of end-organ damage, refractory
hypertension requiring three or more antihypertensive medications, hypertension
that has suddenly become uncontrolled, a rising creatinine level with the use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or other clinical signs of a sec-
ondary cause.
Clinical Presentation
Target organ damage of hypertension includes left ventricular hypertrophy,
nephropathy, retinopathy, and cerebrovascular disease. A complete history and
physical examination, including fundoscopic examination; auscultation of the
major arteries for bruits; palpation of the abdomen for enlarged kidneys, masses,
or an enlarged abdominal aorta; evaluation of the lower extremities for edema
and perfusion; and a neurologic examination, should be standard. Some initial

laboratory testing is also indicated for a patient with a new diagnosis of hyperten-
sion (Table 6–2).
Treatment
Therapy Based on Staging. Initial therapy should be based on the stage or degree
of hypertension. For those with elevated blood pressure (blood pressure 120–129/
< 80 mm Hg), lifestyle modifications and 3- to 6-month follow-up are the only
interventions indicated unless they have another comorbid condition, such as heart
failure or diabetes, which necessitate the use of an antihypertensive.
Patients with stage 1 hypertension (blood pressure 130–139/80–89 mm Hg)
should be risk assessed for CVD; those with a 10-year CVD risk > 10% should
be started on a single antihypertensive agent along with lifestyle modifications,
whereas those with lower CVD only require lifestyle modification and 3- to
6-month follow-up.
Patients with stage 2 hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg) will need lifestyle modi-
fication and antihypertensive medication. Patients starting antihypertensive agents
should receive 1-month follow-up to evaluate whether the patient’s blood pressure
goals are being met or require intensification of therapy.
In 2015, the National Institutes of Health–sponsored systolic blood pressure
intervention trial (SPRINT trial) showed that for patients age 50 or older with at
least one other cardiovascular risk factor, a target blood pressure of 120 mm Hg
(rather than 140 mm Hg) produced a 30% risk reduction in cardiovascular events,
stroke, and cardiovascular death.
Lifestyle Changes. Counseling patients on lifestyle changes is important at any
blood pressure level and includes weight loss, limitation of alcohol intake, increased
aerobic physical activity, reduced sodium intake (< 6 g NaCl or 2.3 g sodium), ces-
sation of smoking, and adherence to a DASH diet.
Pharmacotherapy. For most patients with hypertension, lowering blood pressure
itself reduces cardiac risk and is more important than the choice of agent. Sev-
eral different drugs appear to be equally effective as initial monotherapy. Thiazide
diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor block-
ers (ARBs) are all widely used and acceptable choices. When considering initial
therapy in patients of African descent, evidence shows benefit from the use of thia-
zide diuretics or long-acting calcium channel blockers over other antihypertensives.
ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used for initial monotherapy in patients with
diabetic nephropathy or those with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease compli-
cated by proteinuria because of their ability to reduce intraglomerular pressure via
07_Toy-IM_Case06_p075-088.indd 79 03/09/20 9:13 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,107,"80 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
inhibition of angiotensin II–mediated efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Beta-
blockers are not recommended for initial monotherapy unless there is a specific
indication, such as ischemic heart disease. If patients have markedly elevated blood
pressures at baseline (stage 2 hypertension), a single agent will often not be able to
achieve good blood pressure control, and patients will often require combination
therapy with two or more agents. Whatever drug class is used, a long-acting formu-
lation that provides 24-hour efficacy is preferred over short-acting agents for better
compliance and more consistent blood pressure control. A list of oral antihyperten-
sive drugs is extensive (Table 6–3).
For some patients, there are specific compelling indications to use specific drug
classes. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the agents of choice in hypertensive patients with
diabetes or systolic heart failure. Beta-blockers would be first-line agents in patients
with hypertension and coronary artery disease or a history of tachyarrhythmias.
Alpha-blockers may be considered in men with hypertension and benign prostatic
hypertrophy. Most patients ultimately need more than one drug to control their
blood pressure. It is critical to tailor the treatment to the patient’s personal, finan-
cial, lifestyle, and medical factors and to periodically review compliance and adverse
effects.
SELECTED CAUSES OF SECONDARY HYPERTENSION
Renal Causes
The most common cause of secondary hypertension is renal disease (renal paren-
chymal or renovascular). Renal artery stenosis is caused by atherosclerotic disease
with hemodynamically significant blockage of the renal artery in older patients
or by fibromuscular dysplasia in younger adults. The clinician must have a high
index of suspicion, and further testing may be indicated, for instance, in an indi-
vidual with diffuse atherosclerosis. Abrupt elevations in creatinine after using an
ACE inhibitor or ARB, a renal bruit, recurrent pulmonary edema, or low potas-
sium may be suggestive of renal artery stenosis. Initial imaging options include
renal ultrasound, computed tomographic (CT) angiography, or magnetic reso-
nance (MR) angiography, with MR angiography having the highest sensitivity
and specificity. Captopril-enhanced radionuclide scan is less useful diagnosti-
cally (interrater variability) but may provide functional information about the
stenotic kidney. Surgical or angioplastic correction of the vascular occlusion may
be considered.
Polycystic kidney disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The classic
clinical findings are positive family history of polycystic kidney disease, bilateral
flank masses, flank pain, elevated blood pressure, and hematuria. Other causes of
chronic renal disease very commonly lead to hypertension.
Endocrine causes
Primary hyperaldosteronism is an increasingly recognized cause of hypertension,
contributing to as much as 5% to 10% of patients with hypertension. Although
hyperaldosteronism “classically” presents with hypertension, metabolic alkalosis,
and hypokalemia, more than half of patients will have normal bicarbonate and

potassium levels. A more common presentation is severe hypokalemia provoked
by diuretics. Hyperaldosteronism can be screened for with a renin/aldosterone
ratio. If abnormal, further workup should be pursued to confirm the diagnosis
and determine if the hyperaldosteronism is due to adrenal adenoma or adrenal
hyperplasia.
Hyperthyroidism may also cause hypertension. The patient will have a widened
pulse pressure with increased systolic blood pressure and decreased diastolic blood
pressure, as well as a hyperdynamic precordium. The patient may have warm skin,
tremor, and thyroid gland enlargement or a palpable thyroid nodule. A low level
of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and elevated levels of thyroid hor-
mones (eg, free T ) are diagnostic.

Glucocorticoid excess states, including Cushing syndrome, and iatrogenic (treat-
ment with glucocorticoids) classically present with thinning of the extremities,
truncal obesity, round moon face, supraclavicular fat pad, purple striae, acne, and
possibly psychiatric symptoms. Excess corticosteroids cause secondary hyperten-
sion due to a combination of mineralocorticoid activity and upregulating vascular
sensitivity to vasoconstrictors. Dexamethasone suppression testing of the serum
cortisol level aids in the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome.
Pheochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-releasing adrenal tumor that typi-
cally produces hypertension. Classic clinical manifestations include paroxysmal
headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis, pallor, and chest pain. It can be diagnosed by
elevated urinary and plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine.
Other Causes
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is another fairly common cause of hypertension.
Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by abnormal relaxation of the upper airway
musculature, resulting in hypoxic and hypercarbic episodes during sleep. Over
time, this can lead to systemic vasoconstriction, systolic hypertension, and pul-
monary hypertension. Strongly suspect OSA in a patient with obesity, snoring,
daytime sleepiness, and a crowded palate. OSA is diagnosed with “sleep studies”
(ie, polysomnography) and treated with nighttime continuous positive airway
pressure.
Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aortic lumen and usu-
ally is diagnosed in younger patients by finding hypertension along with discor-
dant upper and lower extremity blood pressures. Coarctation of the aorta can
cause leg claudication, cold extremities, and delayed or diminished femoral pulses
as a result of decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities. Rib notching may
be seen on chest x-ray due to development of collateral circulation. In children,
echocardiography is often diagnostic, while adults may require CT or MR
angiography.

ANSWERS
6.1 C. This question addresses secondary causes of hypertension. This patient’s
central obesity, abdominal striae, hirsutism, and easy bruisability are consis-
tent with Cushing syndrome, which can be diagnosed with a dexamethasone
suppression test and serum cortisol. TSH (answer A) would be useful for
evaluating for hyperthyroidism causing hypertension, which would present
with weight loss, heat intolerance, and tremor. MR angiography (answer B)
is a good diagnostic test for renal artery stenosis, which may present with a
renal bruit. Urinary metanephrine (answer D) can evaluate for pheochro-
mocytoma, which presents with paroxysmal hypertension, headaches, and
diaphoresis.
6.2 B. The prognosis in hypertension depends on the patient’s other cardiovas-
cular risks and observed end-organ damage from hypertension, such as left
ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive retinopathy, or chronic kidney disease.
Vascular biopsy (answer A) is indicated in some patients with vasculitis, which
may present with a wide variety of end-organ damage and inflammatory mark-
ers. Enrollment in clinical trials (answer C) is not required for effective control
of hypertension. Serum homocysteine levels (answer D) are elevated in some
genetic disorders as well as B or folate deficiency.
12
6.3 A. Labetalol, which is a beta blocking agent, is widely used in pregnant women
and is considered safe for the fetus. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin
inhibitors (answers B, C, and D) are contraindicated in all stages of pregnancy.
Thiazide diuretics (E) can cause thrombocytopenia in the fetus and is not
recommended in pregnancy. Methyldopa is an older agent less effective than
labetalol.
6.4 A. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic that is preferred over hydrochlo-
rothiazide by many hypertension experts for its longer acting effects. Recall
that thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred initial therapy
for black patients. Lisinopril (answer B) is an ACE inhibitor, which would be
a reasonable choice in a non-black patient or a necessity in a patient with dia-
betes. Metoprolol (answer C) is not a first-line therapy for hypertension in the
absence of other indications. Clonidine (answer D) is a third- or fourth-line
agent for hypertension; it is not preferred due to potent rebound hypertension
when a patient discontinues the medicine. Spironolactone (answer E) is an
aldosterone antagonist that can be used to treat primary hyperaldosteronism;
it is occasionally used in combination with other medicines to treat refractory
hypertension. It is not a first-line antihypertensive and is not indicated in this
patient.

CLINICAL PEARLS
In general, the diagnosis of hypertension requires two or more blood
»
pressure measurements on at least two visits or the use of ambulatory or
home blood pressure monitoring.
Cardiovascular disease risk evaluation consists of identifying target
»
organ dysfunction and cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes and
hyperlipidemia.
Most patients with hypertension have essential hypertension, but sec-
»
ondary causes of hypertension should be evaluated when clinically
indicated.
A urinalysis, ECG, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and lipids are
»
indicated in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension.
First-line agents for hypertension are thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors,
»
ARBs, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Many patients will
require combination therapy.
Renal diseases, including renovascular hypertension, are the most com-
»
mon causes of secondary hypertension.
Lifestyle modifications consisting of dietary changes, exercise, and mod-
»
eration of alcohol intake are indicated to address hypertension control
and lower overall cardiovascular risk.
For most patients, the degree of blood pressure reduction is the major
»
determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction, rather than the class of anti-
hypertensive drug used.

A 39-year-old man is brought to the emergency center by ambulance after he
was found wandering in the street in a disoriented state. He is confused and
agitated. Further history is obtained from his wife. She reports that for the
last several months he has been complaining of intermittent headaches and
palpitations. He has also experienced feelings of light-headedness when playing
basketball. Three weeks ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and was
started on clonidine twice per day. He took the clonidine for 2 weeks, but the
drug made him feel sedated. Five days ago, he was instructed by his primary
care provider to stop the clonidine and to start taking metoprolol twice daily.
On examination, he is afebrile, with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute (bpm),
respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room
air, and blood pressure of 215/132 mm Hg in both arms. He is agitated and
diaphoretic and is looking around the room but does not appear to recognize
his wife. His pupils are dilated but reactive. On fundoscopic examination, he has
papilledema and scattered retinal hemorrhages. He has no thyromegaly. Heart,
lung, and abdominal examinations are normal. His pulses are bounding and
equal in his arms and legs. He moves his extremities well, his reflexes are brisk
and symmetric, and he is slightly tremulous. Noncontrast computed tomography
(CT) of the head is negative for hemorrhage. Laboratory studies results include
a normal leukocyte count and a hemoglobin level of 16.5 g/dL. Serum sodium

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Define and describe the management of hypertensive emergency and urgency.
(EPA 10)
2. Understand the relationship between systemic blood pressure and cerebral
blood flow. (EPA 3, 12)
3. Describe how to diagnose and medically treat a patient with a pheochromocy-
toma. (EPA 1, 4)
Considerations
Hypertensive encephalopathy, a symptom complex of severely elevated blood pres-
sures, confusion, increased intracranial pressure, and/or seizures, is a diagnosis
of exclusion; other causes for the patient’s acute mental decline, such as stroke,
subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, or mass lesion, must be ruled out. Know-
ing the specific etiology of the patient’s hypertension is not necessary to treat his
encephalopathy; urgent blood pressure lowering is indicated. However, it may be
harmful to normalize the blood pressure too quickly because it may cause cerebral

hypoperfusion. Parenteral medications should be used to lower the blood pressure to
the range of 160/100 to 110 mm Hg.
In addition, the patient has tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, dilated
pupils, and a slight tremor, all signs of a hyperadrenergic state. Pheochromocy-
toma must be considered as a possible underlying etiology of his hypertension. His
antihypertensive medication changes may also be contributory—perhaps rebound
due to discontinuation of clonidine. Moreover, in pheochromocytoma the use of
beta-blockers promotes further hypertension due to the unopposed effect of alpha-
adrenergic stimulation.
APPROACH TO:
Hypertensive Crises/Pheocromocytoma
DEFINITIONS
HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY: Acute elevation in blood pressure with associ-
ated end-organ damage.
HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY: Acute elevation in blood pressure to greater than
180 mm Hg systolic pressure and/or greater than 110 mm Hg diastolic pressure
without evidence of end-organ damage.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO HYPERTENSIVE
CRISIS AND EMERGENCY
Background
Hypertensive crises are critical elevations in blood pressure and are usually clas-
sified as either hypertensive emergencies or urgencies. The presence of acute end-
organ damage constitutes a hypertensive emergency, whereas the absence of such
complications is considered hypertensive urgency. Examples of acute end-organ
damage include hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial ischemia or infarction,
aortic dissection, stroke, declining renal function with proteinuria, microangio-
pathic hemolytic anemia, pulmonary edema secondary to acute left ventricular fail-
ure, and vision loss with papilledema on examination.
Hypertensive emergencies require immediate reduction in blood pressure with
hospitalization for close monitoring. Hypertensive urgencies also require prompt
medical attention, but the blood pressure can be lowered over 1 to 2 days and moni-
tored in the outpatient setting for patients with reliable follow-up.
Hypertensive crises are uncommon but occur most often in patients with
an established history of essential hypertension (hypertension without an
apparent underlying cause). A crisis may also be precipitated by use of sympa-
thomimetic agents, such as cocaine, or by conditions that produce excess sym-
pathetic discharge, such as clonidine withdrawal. Hypertensive crises also result
08_Toy-IM_Case07_p089-098.indd 91 03/09/20 9:13 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,119,"92 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
from underlying diseases that cause hypertension, such as renovascular disease
(eg, renal artery stenosis), renal parenchymal disease (eg, glomerulonephritis), and
pheochromocytoma.
Pathophysiology
Although the pathophysiology is not completely understood, abrupt rises in vas-
cular resistance are met with endothelial compensation by the release of vasodila-
tor molecules such as nitric oxide. If the increase in arterial pressure persists, the
endothelial response is overwhelmed and decompensates, leading to a further rise
in pressure and endothelial damage and dysfunction.
Cerebral blood flow is a good example of vascular compensation by vasodilation
or vasoconstriction in response to changes in arterial pressure (Figure 7–1). In
normotensive adults, cerebral blood flow remains relatively constant over a range of
mean arterial pressures between 60 and 120 mm Hg because cerebral vasoconstric-
tion limits excessive cerebral perfusion. In patients with chronic hypertension, this
regulation curve is shifted to the right due to the long-term change in pressure. As
the mean arterial pressure increases beyond the normal range of cerebral autoregu-
lation, there is cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction and increased permeabil-
ity of the blood-brain barrier. This leads to vasogenic edema and the formation of
microhemorrhages that manifest as symptoms and signs of hypertensive encepha-
lopathy, such as lethargy, confusion, headaches, or vision changes. Typical imaging
findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include posterior leukoencepha-
lopathy, usually in the parietooccipital regions, which may or may not be seen on
CT scanning. Without therapy, hypertensive encephalopathy can lead to seizures,
coma, and death.

Case Files Internal Medicine,120,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 93
Treatment
The definition of hypertensive emergency does not require numerical thresh-
olds of arterial pressure but is based on end-organ effects. Autoregulation failure
can occur in previously normotensive individuals at blood pressures as low as
160/100 mm Hg; however, individuals with long-standing hypertension frequently
develop adaptive mechanisms (eg, cerebral arterial autoregulation) and may not
show clinical manifestations until the blood pressure rises to above 220/110 mm
Hg. Thus, emergent treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy (and indeed, all
hypertensive emergencies) should focus on the symptoms rather than the numbers.
In fact, it may be dangerous to “normalize” the blood pressure of patients with
chronic hypertension too quickly. Rapid lowering of blood pressures may lead to
decreased perfusion to the brain due to the rightward shift in the blood pressure
autoregulation curve. This results in cerebral ischemia or infarction or in renal or
coronary hypoperfusion. Usually, a reasonable goal is reduction of mean arterial
pressures by no more than 20% or to a diastolic blood pressure of 110 to 120 mm Hg
in the first hour and further 15% reduction in the following 23 hours.
Treatment of hypertensive emergencies usually necessitates parenteral medication
without delay; direct blood pressure monitoring with an arterial catheter often is
necessary. One of the most commonly used medications for treating hypertensive
emergencies is sodium nitroprusside. It has the advantage of nearly instantaneous
onset of action, and its dose can be easily titrated for a smooth reduction in blood
pressure. However, its metabolite may accumulate, resulting in cyanide or thiocya-
nate toxicity when it is given for more than 2 to 3 days. Certain clinical situations
may favor the use of other medications. Intravenous loop diuretics and vasodila-
tors such as nitroglycerin decrease the preload (central venous pressure) in acute
pulmonary edema. Myocardial ischemia or infarction is treated with intravenous
nitroglycerin to improve coronary perfusion and beta-blockers to reduce blood
pressure, heart rate, and myocardial oxygen demand. Patients with aortic dissection
benefit from medications that reduce the shear forces affecting the aorta, which will
help limit propagation of the dissection. A useful technique in treating these indi-
viduals is the use of intravenous nitroprusside to lower the arterial blood pressure
and a beta-blocker to blunt reflex tachycardia. Alternatively, intravenous labetalol, a
combined alpha- and beta-blocker, alone can be used. Patients presenting with acute
cerebral infarction generally should not have acute blood pressure lowering unless the
systolic blood pressure is greater than 220 mm Hg because of the possibility of wors-
ening cerebral ischemia.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
Epidemiology
The vast majority of hypertension has no discernible cause (essential hyperten-
sion), but some patients have secondary causes, such as renal artery stenosis,
hyperaldosteronism, or pheochromocytoma. Less than 10% of pheochromocyto-
mas are familial, and these tend to be bilateral. One should consider screening for
the presence of the RET proto-oncogene seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia
08_Toy-IM_Case07_p089-098.indd 93 03/09/20 9:13 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,121,"94 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
type II (MEN II) or the VHL gene for von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, as well as
screening family members for these diseases and for familial pheochromocytoma
and neurofibromatosis.
Pathophysiology
Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing tumors that arise from chro-
maffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is
established by measuring increased concentrations of catecholamines or their
metabolites in either urine or plasma. Usually, a 24-hour urine collection is assayed
for metanephrines and catecholamines. One-time measurement of plasma-free
metanephrines is a convenient and fairly sensitive screening test. After the bio-
chemical tests document the excess catecholamines, the next step is to locate the
tumor for surgical removal. Approximately 90% of pheochromocytomas are in the
adrenal gland, usually identified by CT or MRI. If the initial imaging is unreveal-
ing, scintigraphic localization with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) or
an octreotide (somatostatin analog) scan is indicated.
Clinical Presentation
This patient’s history of paroxysmal hypertension with headaches, palpitations,
and hyperadrenergic state (dilated pupils, diaphoresis) suggests the diagnosis of
pheochromocytoma. Other symptoms may include episodic anxiety, tremor, and
orthostatic hypotension caused by volume contraction from pressure-induced
natriuresis. Although uncommon, accounting for only 0.01% to 0.1% of hyperten-
sive individuals, these tumors have important therapeutic considerations.
Treatment
The treatment of choice for these tumors is surgical resection, but it is critical to
reverse the acute and chronic effects of the excess catecholamines prior to excision
(Figure 7–2). Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as phenoxybenzamine, an irre-
versible, long-acting agent, are started 2 weeks prior to surgery to help prevent hyper-
tensive exacerbations, which are especially worrisome during surgery. A liberal salt
diet is initiated to expand the commonly seen contracted blood volume. Sometimes
a beta-blocking agent is started, but only after alpha-blockade is established. The
products of pheochromocytomas stimulate both the alpha- and beta-adrenergic
receptors; thus, using a beta-blocker alone may worsen the hypertension because

7.2 An 80-year-old woman with no significant past medical history undergoes sur-
gery for a hip fracture. She tolerates the procedure well. On postoperative day
1 she reports moderate hip pain, but no chest pain, headache, shortness of
breath, or palpitations. She is alert, awake, and oriented to person, place, and
time. Her pulse is 95 bpm, temperature is 99.5 °F, respiratory rate is 18 breaths
per minute, and blood pressure is 172/106 mm Hg. Over the past 24 hours,
she has made 1000 mL of clear, yellow urine. Which of the following is the best
next step?
A. Transfer the patient to the ICU, obtain cardiac enzyme levels, and lower
the blood pressures to the 140/90 mm Hg range.
B. Control the pain and monitor the blood pressure.
C. Start the patient on a beta-blocker and monitor the blood pressure.
D. Restrict visitors and turn down the television, alarms, and other noise.
7.3 A 61-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease com-
plains of progressive orthopnea, pedal edema, and dyspnea on exertion for
the past 3 months. He is hospitalized with a pulse of 78 bpm, temperature
of 98.6 °F, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of
190/105 mm Hg. He has bilateral 2+ pitting edema above the ankles. Cardiac
enzyme levels and an electrocardiogram are normal, but an echocardiogram
is still pending. Intravenous furosemide has been administered. Which of the
following is the best next step?
A. Prescribe a beta-blocker to decrease myocardial oxygen demands.
B. Start intravenous dopamine.
C. Observe his clinical status.
D. Start an ACE inhibitor.
7.4 A 58-year-old woman with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation presents
to the emergency room with aphasia and right arm weakness for the past
8 hours. She is nonadherent to her medication regimen. Pulse is 86 bpm, tem-
perature is 99 °F, blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg, and her respiratory rate
is 14 breaths per minute. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular
rhythm. Pulmonary examination is normal. CT scan shows no intracranial
hemorrhage. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A. Normalize the blood pressure with beta-blockade.
B. Admit to the ICU with sodium nitroprusside.
C. Normalize the blood pressure with an ACE inhibitor.
D. Observe the blood pressure.
ANSWERS
7.1 C. This man has a hypertensive urgency—elevated blood pressures without end-
organ symptoms. The appropriate treatment is reinitiation of blood pressure
medications and reassessment in 24 to 48 hours. Answer A (hospitalization)
08_Toy-IM_Case07_p089-098.indd 96 03/09/20 9:13 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,124,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 97
would be indicated if the patient had symptoms of end-organ damage such as
headache, chest pain, altered mental status, and so on. Answer B (clonidine)
would not be good maintenance therapy, given questions regarding his compli-
ance with treatment and the risk of rebound hypertension. Answer D (refer to
social worker and do not prescribe antihypertensives) is incorrect because it is
unethical not to treat this patient with critically high blood pressures. While
the patient’s nonadherence should be explored and addressed, it is imperative
to get the blood pressure controlled first.
7.2 B. Elevated blood pressure without symptoms may occur acutely after sur-
gery, particularly because of postoperative pain. Answer C (starting beta-
blocker therapy) would be appropriate only if the patient had critically
elevated blood pressures (systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg and diastolic
blood pressure > 110 mm Hg) or symptoms of end-organ damage. Blood
pressure medications are usually not indicated when the pressures are below
the malignant range; rather, pain control is the primary treatment. Lowering
the blood pressure excessively can lead to orthostatic hypotension when the
patient gets out of bed. Answer A (admitting to the ICU and obtaining cardiac
enzymes) is not necessary in an asymptomatic patient whose increased blood
pressure can be explained by postoperative pain. Answer D (restrict visitors,
limit noise) would not treat the patient’s underlying pain.
7.3 D. Elevated blood pressures may exacerbate congestive heart failure and must
be treated. Both ACE inhibitors and oral nitrates or intravenous nitroglycer-
ine are used to treat acute heart failure. ACE inhibition reduces afterload, and
oral nitrates or intravenous nitroglycerine reduce preload. Answer A (prescrib-
ing beta-blockers) would be inappropriate for this patient; beta-blockers are
generally avoided when patients are volume overloaded because beta-block-
ers decrease myocardial contractility and can thus worsen acute heart failure.
Answer B (treatment with intravenous dopamine) would be inappropriate for
this patient because the dopamine may exacerbate the increased blood pres-
sure and peripheral resistance. Answer C (observe the clinical status) is not
appropriate with a blood pressure so high.
7.4 D. In general, blood pressure should not be acutely decreased (unless systolic
blood pressure > 220 mm Hg) in an individual suspected of having an isch-
emic stroke because of the concern for cerebral hypoperfusion and worsening
brain ischemia. If thrombolytic therapy is considered, blood pressure should
be controlled to < 185/100 mm Hg, but this patient’s symptom duration pre-
cludes that consideration. In contrast, patients with intracerebral hemorrhage
require urgent blood pressure decrease to values of 140 mm Hg systolic or
less to decrease the propagation of the hemorrhage. Answers A (normalize the
blood pressure with beta-blockade), B (admit to ICU with sodium nitroprus-
side), and C (normalize the blood pressure with an ACE inhibitor) are inap-
propriate in this patient with an ischemic stroke.

A 26-year-old Nigerian woman presents to the emergency center complaining
of the sudden onset of palpitations, severe shortness of breath, and coughing.
She reports that she has experienced several episodes of palpitations in the past,
often lasting 1 or 2 days, but never with dyspnea. She has a history of rheumatic
fever at the age of 14. She is now pregnant at 20 weeks’ gestation with her first
child and takes prenatal vitamins. She denies the use of any other medications,
tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs.
On examination, her heart rate ranges from 110 to 130 beats per minute

CLINICAL APPROACH
Background and Epidemiology
Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia for which patients seek treatment;
it occurs in acute, paroxysmal, and chronic forms. With AF, there is disordered
atrial depolarization from multiple irritable foci, often at rates exceeding 300 to
400 bpm; these atrial impulses produce an irregular ventricular response, depend-
ing on the number of impulses that are conducted through the atrioventricular
(AV) node. The ECG is characterized by the absence of discrete P waves and an RR
interval without a repetitive pattern, commonly referred to as an irregularly irregu-
lar rhythm. The incidence of AF increases with age, affecting 5% to 10% of patients
older than 75 years. Although many patients can maintain a normal activity level
and remain essentially asymptomatic with chronic AF, there are several causes of
morbidity from this arrhythmia: It may trigger a rapid ventricular rate, leading to
myocardial ischemia, exacerbation of heart failure in patients with heart disease,
and thrombus formation in the noncontractile atrial appendage, which can lead to
systemic embolization (AF is a common cause of ischemic stroke).
Pathophysiology
Anything that causes atrial dilation or excessive sympathetic tone can lead to AF,
but the two most common causes of AF are hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis.
The common causes of AF are listed in Table 8–1.
Treatment
Acute AF. Acute AF with rapid ventricular response must be addressed quickly. The
four major goals are (1) hemodynamic stabilization, (2) rate control, (3) anticoagu-
lation, and (4) possible conversion to sinus rhythm. If a patient is hemodynamically
unstable (hypotensive, angina pectoris, pulmonary edema), urgent DC cardiover-
sion is indicated. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, ventricular rate control
can generally be achieved with intravenous beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers,
or digoxin, which slow conduction through the AV node. Once the ventricular
rate has been controlled, the underlying cause (eg, thyrotoxicosis, use of adrener-
gic stimulants, or worsening heart failure) should be reversed so that patients can
undergo cardioversion to sinus rhythm. This may occur spontaneously or after cor-
rection of underlying abnormalities, or it may require pharmacologic or electrical

Case Files Internal Medicine,129,"102 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
cardioversion. If the duration of AF exceeds 48 hours, the risk of intra-atrial throm-
bus formation increases.
Rate control alone (ie, the use of agents to maintain a slow ventricular response
rate) is often effective in managing the symptoms of AF, and it has been shown to
be as effective as rhythm control for long-term outcomes.
However, if patients are unstable or persistently symptomatic, they may
require efforts to terminate the AF and restore sinus rhythm. The most effec-
tive method of terminating AF is electrical cardioversion. After cardioversion, the
return of coordinated atrial contraction in the presence of an atrial thrombus
may result in clot embolization, leading to a cerebral infarction or other isch-
emic event. Therefore, after 24 to 48 hours of AF, patients should receive 3 to
4 weeks of anticoagulant therapy prior to and after cardioversion to reduce the
risk of thromboembolic phenomena. Alternatively, low-risk patients can undergo
transesophageal echocardiography to exclude the presence of an atrial append-
age thrombus prior to cardioversion. Postcardioversion anticoagulation is still
required for 4 additional weeks, because though the rhythm returns to sinus,
the atria do not contract normally for some time. Pharmacologic antiarrhythmic
agents, such as propafenone, sotalol, and amiodarone, may be used to try to main-
tain sinus rhythm.
Many patients with AF even after cardioversion do not remain in sinus rhythm.
Two important prognostic factors are left atrial dilation (atrial diameter > 4.5 cm
predicts failure of cardioversion) and duration of AF. The longer the patient is in
AF, the more likely the patient is to stay in that rhythm as a consequence of electri-
cal remodeling of the heart.
Chronic AF. In patients with chronic AF, the management goals are rate control,
using drugs to reduce AV nodal conduction (such as digoxin or beta-blockers) as
described previously, and anticoagulation. Patients with chronic AF who are not
anticoagulated have a 1% to 5% per year incidence of clinically evident embolization
such as stroke. Risk assessment tools such as the CHA DS -VASc (see Table 8–2
2 2
for definition) score can be used to estimate stroke risk and need for anticoagulation.
The CHA DS -VASc score correlates an increasing event rate with an increasing
2 2
score (Tables 8–2 and 8–3).

For chronic AF caused by valvular disease such as mitral stenosis, the annual
risk of stroke is substantially higher. AF that develops in patients younger than
60 years without evidence of structural heart disease, hypertension, or other fac-
tors for stroke is termed lone AF, and the risk of stroke is very low, so anticoagula-
tion with warfarin is not used. Instead, aspirin may be used.
Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke by two-thirds in patients with chronic
AF. New oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been devel-
oped for use in AF, but the oral vitamin K antagonist warfarin remains the most
widely used medication for this purpose. Warfarin does not produce a predictable
dose-related response; therefore, the level of anticoagulation needs to be monitored
by regular laboratory testing using the international normalized ratio (INR). In AF
not caused by valvular disease, the target INR is 2 to 3.
The most common complication of warfarin therapy is bleeding resulting from
excessive anticoagulation. The risk of bleeding increases with the INR. If the INR
is markedly elevated (eg, INR 6–9) but there is no apparent bleeding, the values
will return to normal over several days if the warfarin is held. For higher levels of
INR (> 9) without bleeding, vitamin K can be administered. If clinically significant
bleeding is present, warfarin toxicity can be rapidly reversed with administration
of vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and prothrombin complex concentrate to
replace clotting factors and provide intravascular volume replacement.
Rheumatic Heart Disease
In this case, the cause of this patient’s AF appears to be rheumatic mitral stenosis.
Rheumatic heart disease is a late sequela of acute rheumatic fever, usually becoming
symptomatic many years after the original illness. Valvular thickening, fibrosis, and
calcifications lead to valvular stenosis. The mitral valve is most frequently involved.
The aortic valve may also develop stenosis in combination with the mitral valve.
The right side of the heart is rarely involved. Most cases of mitral stenosis in adults
are secondary to rheumatic heart disease, especially in the developing world. Con-
genital mitral stenosis is also commonly seen.
The physical signs of mitral stenosis are a loud S and an opening snap following S.
1 2
The S -OS (mitral valve opening snap) interval narrows as the severity of the
2
stenosis increases. There is a low-pitched diastolic rumble after the opening snap,
heard best at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope. Because of the stenotic
09_Toy-IM_Case08_p099-108.indd 103 03/09/20 9:12 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,131,"104 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
valve, pressure in the left atrium is increased, leading to left atrial dilation and, ulti-
mately, pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can cause hemoptysis
and signs of right-sided heart failure, such as peripheral edema. When AF devel-
ops, the rapid ventricular response causes shortened diastolic filling time, leading
to fluid accumulation in the pulmonary system with eventual pulmonary conges-
tion. Rate control with intravenous beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers is
essential to relieve pulmonary symptoms. In this case, the mitral stenosis likely
became symptomatic due to the patient’s pregnancy, with increased blood volume
and increased cardiac output of up to 30% to 50%.
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome
Another cause of AF is the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. In patients
with this condition, AF may be life threatening. In addition to the AV node,
patients with WPW have an accessory pathway that provides an alternate route
for electrical communication between the atria and ventricles. This alternative
route leads to pre-excitation, an early ventricular depolarization that begins prior
to normal AV nodal conduction. A portion of ventricular activation occurs over
the accessory pathway, with the remainder occurring normally through the His-
Purkinje system. This pre-excitation is recognized on the ECG as a delta wave, or
early upslurring of the R wave, which both widens the QRS complex and shortens
the PR interval (Figure 8–2).
Some patients with the ECG abnormalities of WPW syndrome are asymptom-
atic. Others have recurrent tachyarrhythmias, mostly paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia; one-third of patients have AF. AF with conduction to the ventricles
over an accessory pathway is a special case for two reasons. First, when conducted
through the accessory pathway, the widened QRS may look like ventricular tachy-
cardia, except that it will have the irregular RR interval of AF. Second, because the

AV conduction is occurring through the accessory pathway rather than through
the AV node, the ventricular rate may be very rapid, and the usual AV nodal–
blocking drugs given for ventricular rate control will not affect the accessory path-
way. In fact, beta-blockers, verapamil, and other AV nodal–blocking agents can,
paradoxically, increase the ventricular rate and should be avoided in WPW patients
with AF. If hemodynamically unstable, DC cardioversion should be performed. If
hemodynamically stable, the agent of choice is procainamide or ibutilide to slow
conduction and convert the rhythm to sinus.

8.4 A 59-year-old woman has been placed on warfarin after being found to have
chronic AF. She is noted to have an INR of 5.8, is asymptomatic, and has no
overt bleeding. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?
A. Transfuse with erythrocytes.
B. Give vitamin K.
C. Give fresh frozen plasma
D. Hold warfarin.
8.5 A 45-year-old woman is noted to have dizziness, a pounding feeling in her

blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg and a heart rate of 180 bpm. On ECG, she
has AF, and a prior baseline ECG showed delta waves. The emergency depart-
ment provider counsels the patient regarding cardioversion, but the patient
declines. Which of the following is the best therapy for her condition?
A. Digoxin
B. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
C. Calcium channel blocker
D. Procainamide
ANSWERS
8.1 A. A diastolic rumble at the cardiac apex suggests mitral stenosis. The early
diastolic decrescendo murmur (answer B) is typical of aortic regurgitation;
holosystolic murmur at the apex (answer C) is typical of mitral regurgitation;
and late-peaking systolic murmur at the upper sternal border (answer D) is
typical of aortic stenosis.
8.2 B. This individual has significant symptoms and hypotension caused by the AF
and rapid ventricular rate; this is an unstable patient, and thus DC cardiover-
sion is the treatment of choice. The other answer choices (answer A, digoxin,
and answer D, diltiazem) would take time to work, and additionally answer C
(vagal maneuvers) could potentially compromise cerebral blood flow if carotid
massage is used.
8.3 A. Clinical factors associated with a higher risk for embolic stroke include con-
gestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 65, diabetes, or prior stroke. Echo-
cardiographic factors include dilated left atrium or the presence of an atrial
thrombus. The man in answer A has “lone AF” with a CHADS score < 2
2
and has a low risk for stroke; thus, he would not benefit from anticoagulation.
The other answer choices have high CHADS scores based on age and other
2
comorbidities.
8.4 D. The target INR with warfarin is 2 to 3; thus, 5.8 is markedly elevated. How-
ever, because this patient has no overt bleeding and is asymptomatic, hold-
ing the warfarin until the INR reaches the acceptable range is a reasonable
approach. Answer A (transfusion) is not indicated since the patient did not
09_Toy-IM_Case08_p099-108.indd 106 03/09/20 9:12 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,134,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 107
have bleeding. Patients with overt bleeding require more urgent intervention,
such as administration of vitamin K (answer B), FFP (answer C), or prothrom-
bin complex concentrate to replenish clotting factors.
8.5 D. This patient has AF with WPW, as indicated by the delta wave. In this set-
ting, the typical agents (answer A, digoxin; answer B, angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor; and answer C, calcium channel blocker) used to treat AF
that slow the AV node are contraindicated since the conduction through the
accessory pathway could accelerate, leading to ventricular tachycardia. DC car-
dioversion is an option; however, in a hemodynamically stable patient, procain-
amide may be used since it will slow propagation through the accessory
pathway. Because this patient declines cardioversion, procainamide is the best
choice.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The most common causes of AF are hypertension, atherosclerotic heart

A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after fainting while
in church. He stood up to sing a hymn and then fell to the floor. His wife, who
witnessed the episode, reports that he was unconscious for approximately 2 or
3 minutes. When he woke up, he was groggy for another minute or two and then
seemed himself. No abnormal movements were noted. This had never happened
to him before, but his wife does report that for the last several months he has had
to curtail activities, such as mowing the lawn, because he becomes weak and feels
light-headed. His only medical history is osteoarthritis of the knees, for which he
takes acetaminophen.
On examination, he is alert, talkative, and smiling. He is afebrile, his heart rate
is 35 beats per minute (bpm), and his blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, which
remains unchanged on standing. He has contusions on his face, left arm, and
chest wall, but no lacerations. His chest is clear to auscultation, and his heart
rhythm is regular but bradycardic with a nondisplaced apical impulse. He has
no focal deficits. Laboratory examination shows negative cardiac enzymes and
normal blood counts, renal function, and serum electrolyte levels. His rhythm strip
is shown in Figure 9–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 9:
Syncope and Heart Block
Summary: A 72-year-old man presents with
A witnessed syncopal episode, brief and without seizure activity

Decreased exercise tolerance recently because of weakness and presyncopal symptoms

Bradycardia, with third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block on electrocardiogram

(ECG)
Most likely diagnosis: Syncope as a consequence of third-degree AV block. The
arrows in Figure 9–1 point to P waves.
Next step: Placement of a temporary transcutaneous or transvenous pacemaker and
evaluation for placement of a permanent pacemaker.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the major causes of syncope and important historical clues to the
diagnosis. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Understand the basic evaluation of syncope based on the history. (EPA 1, 3, 10)
3. Recognize vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus hypersensitivity. (EPA 1, 3)
4. Describe diagnosis and management of first-, second-, and third-degree
AV block. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
There are two major considerations to the management of this patient: recogniz-
ing the cause and managing his AV block. He should be evaluated for myocardial
infarction and structural cardiac abnormalities. If this evaluation is negative, he may
simply have conduction system disease because of aging. Atropine or isoproterenol
can be used as a temporary measure when the conduction block is at the level of the
AV node. However, in this case the heart rate is less than 40 bpm and the QRS is
widened, suggesting that the defect is below the AV node, in the bundles of His.
A permanent pacemaker will likely be required.

APPROACH TO:
Syncope
DEFINITIONS
CARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE: Syncope due to the heart’s intrinsic failure to gener-
ate sufficient cardiac output.
ORTHOSTATIC SYNCOPE: Syncope due to failure of appropriate systemic
vasoconstriction, measured by a 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic pressure and a
10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic pressure.
SYNCOPE: A transient loss of consciousness and postural tone with subsequent
spontaneous recovery.
VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: Fainting due to excessive vagal tone causing impaired
autonomic responses such as hypotension without appropriate rise in heart rate or
vasomotor tone.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Syncope is a very common phenomenon, resulting in 3% of emergency center visits
and 1% of subsequent hospitalizations. The causes are varied, but they all result
in transiently diminished cerebral perfusion, leading to loss of consciousness. The
prognosis is quite varied, ranging from a benign episode in an otherwise young,
healthy person with a clear precipitating event, such as emotional stress, to a more
serious occurrence in an older patient with cardiac disease. In the latter situation,
syncope has been referred to as “sudden cardiac death, averted.” For that reason,
higher-risk patients routinely undergo hospitalization and sometimes extensive
evaluation to determine the cause.
Pathophysiology
Traditionally, the etiologies of syncope have been divided into neurogenic, vaso-
vagal, orthostatic, and cardiogenic—either arrhythmias or outflow obstruction.
Table 9–1 lists the most common causes of syncope. By far, the most useful evalu-
ation for diagnosing the cause of syncope is the patient’s history. Because, by defini-
tion, the patient was unconscious, the patient may only be able to report preceding
and subsequent symptoms, so finding a witness to describe the episode is extremely
helpful.
Neurogenic Syncope
Neurogenic syncope results from dysfunction of the autonomic function, which
leads to orthostatic hypotension as described in diabetes mellitus, multisystem
atrophy, and idiopathic dysautonomia. Other neurologic diseases in the differen-
tial diagnosis for syncope include vertebrobasilar insufficiency, seizures, and tran-
sient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Vertebrobasilar insufficiency with resultant loss of

consciousness is often discussed yet rarely seen in clinical practice. Seizure episodes
are a common cause of transient loss of consciousness, and distinguishing seizure
episodes from syncopal episodes based on history often is quite difficult. Loss of
consciousness associated with seizure typically lasts longer than 5 minutes, with a
prolonged postictal period, whereas patients with syncope usually become reori-
ented quickly. To further complicate matters, the same lack of cerebral blood flow
that produced the loss of consciousness can lead to postsyncopal seizure activity.
Seizures are best discussed elsewhere, so our discussion here is confined to syn-
cope. Syncope is essentially never a result of TIAs because syncope reflects global
cerebral hypoperfusion, and TIAs are a result of regional ischemia.
Vasovagal Syncope
Vasovagal syncope refers to excessive vagal tone causing impaired autonomic
responses, that is, a fall in blood pressure without appropriate rise in heart rate or
vasomotor tone. This is, by far, the most common cause of syncope and is the usual
cause of a “fainting spell” in an otherwise healthy young person. Episodes often are
precipitated by physical or emotional stress or by a painful experience. There is
usually a clear precipitating event by history and, often, prodromal symptoms such
as nausea, yawning, or diaphoresis. The episodes are brief, lasting seconds to min-
utes, with a rapid recovery. Syncopal episodes also can be triggered by physiologic
10_Toy-IM_Case09_p109-116.indd 112 03/09/20 9:12 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,140,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 113
activities that increase vagal tone, such as micturition, defecation, or coughing in
otherwise healthy people. Vasovagal syncope needs to be differentiated from ortho-
static hypotension.
Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is also vagally mediated. This usually occurs in
older men, and episodes can be triggered by turning the head to the side, wearing
a tight collar, or even shaving the neck over the area. Pressure over one or both
carotid sinuses causes excess vagal activity with resultant cardiac slowing and can
produce sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, or even AV block. Less commonly, carotid
sinus pressure can induce a fall in arterial pressure without cardiac slowing. When
recurrent syncope as a result of bradyarrhythmia occurs, a demand pacemaker is
often required.
Orthostatic Hypotension
Patients with orthostatic hypotension typically report symptoms related to posi-
tional changes, such as rising from a seated or recumbent position. In orthostatic
hypotension, the postural drop in systolic blood pressure by more than 20 mm Hg, or
10 mm Hg diastolic, within 3 minutes of standing, can be demonstrated on exami-
nation. This can occur because of hypovolemia (hemorrhage, anemia, diarrhea, or
vomiting) or with impaired autonomic response despite adequate circulating blood
volume. The most common reason for this autonomic impairment probably is iat-
rogenic as a result of antihypertensive or other medications, especially in elderly
persons. It also can be caused by autonomic insufficiency seen in diabetic neuropa-
thy, in a syndrome of chronic idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in older men, or in
other primary neurologic conditions (Parkinsonism or idiopathic dysautonomia).
Multiple unwitnessed events (not corroborated) or those that occur only in periods
of emotional upset suggest factitious symptoms.
Cardiogenic Syncope
Etiologies of cardiogenic syncope include rhythm disturbances and structural heart
abnormalities. Certain structural heart abnormalities will cause obstruction of
blood flow to the brain, resulting in syncope. These include aortic stenosis and
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Syncope due to cardiac
outflow obstruction can also occur with cardiac tamponade, massive pulmonary
embolism, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Syncope caused by cardiac outflow
obstruction typically presents during or immediately after exertion. An echocardio-
gram often is obtained to elucidate such abnormalities.
Arrhythmias. Arrhythmias, usually bradyarrhythmias, are the most common car-
diac cause of syncope. Sinus bradycardia, most often due to degenerative sinoatrial
(SA) node dysfunction, and AV node block are bradyarrhythmic causes of syn-
cope. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in elderly patients is one of the most common
causes for pacemaker placement. Patients with SSS may experience sinus brady-
cardia or arrest, alternating with a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), most often
atrial fibrillation (tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). Additionally, prolonged QT
interval may induce syncope. This can be acquired due to hypokalemia, hypomag-
nesemia, or medication use (eg, ondansetron). Also, some patients have congenital
prolonged QT syndromes. Tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter,
10_Toy-IM_Case09_p109-116.indd 113 03/09/20 9:12 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,141,"114 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
SVT, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation are more likely to produce
palpitations than syncope. Often, the rhythm abnormality is apparent by routine
ECG, or if it occurs paroxysmally, it can be recorded using a 24-hour Holter moni-
tor or an event monitor. Sometimes evaluation requires invasive electrophysiologic
studies to assess sinus node or AV node function or to induce supraventricular or
ventricular arrhythmias.
Heart Block. There are three types of AV node block, all based on ECG findings.
First-degree AV block is a prolonged PR interval longer than 200 ms (more than
one large box in ECG). This is a conduction delay in the AV node. Prognosis is
good, and there is usually no need for pacing.
Second-degree AV block comes in two types. Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) is a
progressive lengthening of the PR interval, until a dropped beat is produced. The
resulting P wave of the dropped beat is not followed by a QRS complex. This phe-
nomenon is caused by abnormal conduction in the AV node and may be the result
of an inferior myocardial infarction. Prognosis is good, and there is generally no
need for pacing unless the patient is symptomatic (ie, bradycardia, syncope, heart
failure, asystole > 3 seconds). On the other hand, Mobitz type II produces dropped
beats without lengthening of the PR interval. This is usually caused by a block within
the bundle of His. Permanent pacing is often indicated in these patients because
the Mobitz type II AV block may later progress to complete heart block.
Third-degree AV block is a complete heart block, where the SA node and AV
node fire at independent rates. The atrial rhythm is faster than the ventricular
escape rhythm. Permanent pacing is indicated in these patients, especially when
associated with symptoms such as exercise intolerance or syncope.

diabetic retinopathy, and she states that she cannot feel her legs. She has recur-
rent episodes of light-headedness when she gets up in the morning. She comes

A. Carotid massage
B. Echocardiogram
C. Computed tomographic scan of the head
D. Serial cardiac enzymes
9.4 A 49-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of
an inferior myocardial infarction. His heart rate is 35 bpm, and blood pressure
is 90/50 mm Hg. His ECG shows a Mobitz type I heart block. Which of the
following is the best next step?
A. Atropine
B. Transvenous pacer
C. Lidocaine
D. Observation
ANSWERS
9.1 D. A young patient without a medical history, without seizure activity, and
with a history suggestive of emotionally mediated vasovagal syncope has an
excellent prognosis. The other answer choices for further evaluation or hospi-
talization are not needed in this patient.
9.2 C. This diabetic patient has evidence of microvascular disease, including
peripheral neuropathy, and likely has autonomic dysfunction. Although this
is the most likely etiology, one must be concerned about a possible cardiac
issue since the patient has numerous cardiovascular risk factors; an evaluation
should include an ECG. Answer A (carotid sinus hypersensitivity) is associ-
ated with fainting when wearing a tight collar or turning one’s head. Answer B
(pulmonary embolism) is associated with shortness of breath and chest pain.
Answer D (critical aortic stenosis) is associated with angina and a harsh sys-
tolic ejection murmur.
10_Toy-IM_Case09_p109-116.indd 115 03/09/20 9:12 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,143,"116 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
9.3 A. This patient likely has carotid hypersensitivity; thus, careful carotid mas-
sage (after auscultation to ensure no bruits are present) may be performed
in an attempt to reproduce the symptoms. Carotid massage in an older
patient should be used with caution because it may lead to cerebral ischemia,
plaque embolization, or atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography of the head
(answer C) would be appropriate if a stroke were suspected, and serial cardiac
enzymes (answer D) would be indicated if angina were present or to rule out
a myocardial infarction.
9.4 A. This patient’s bradycardia is severe, probably a result of the inferior myocar-
dial infarction. Atropine is the agent of choice in this situation. Mobitz type I
block has a good prognosis (vs complete heart block), so transvenous pacing
(answer B) is not usually required. Pacing would be required for a Mobitz
type II block or complete heart block. Answer C (lidocaine) is usually used
for ventricular ectopy such as frequent premature ventricular contractions.
Answer D (observation) may be considered in a patient with mild bradycardia
(such as a heart rate of 50-60 bpm) and normal BP.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope in healthy
»
young people. It often has a precipitating event, prodromal symptoms,
and an excellent prognosis.
Carotid sinus hypersensitivity causes bradyarrhythmias in older patients
»
with pressure over the carotid bulb and sometimes requires a pacemaker.
Syncope caused by cardiac outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis,
»
occurs during or after exertion.
Syncope is a very common problem, affecting nearly one-third of the
»
adult population at some point, but a specific cause is identified in less
than half of cases.
Permanent pacing usually is indicated for symptomatic bradyarrhyth-
»
mias (eg, sick sinus syndrome), Mobitz II AV block, or third-degree
heart block.

A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency center complaining of
retrosternal chest pain for the past 2 days. The pain is constant, unrelated to
exertion, worsened by deep breaths, and relieved by sitting up and leaning
forward. She denies any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis.
On examination, her temperature is 99.4 °F, heart rate is 104 beats per minute
(bpm), and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. She is sitting forward on the stretcher
taking shallow breaths. Her conjunctivae are clear, and her oral mucosa is pink and
notable for two aphthous ulcers. Her neck veins are not distended; her chest is
clear to auscultation and is mildly tender to palpation. Her heart rhythm is regular,
with a harsh scratchy sound over the apex heard during systole and diastole. Her
abdominal examination is unremarkable, and her extremities show warmth and
swelling of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of both hands.
Laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell count of 2100 cells/mm3,
hemoglobin concentration 10.4 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume 94 fL, and
platelet count 78,000/mm3. Her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are
normal. Urinalysis shows 10 to 20 white blood cells and 5 to 10 red blood cells per
high-powered field. A urine drug screen is negative.
Chest x-ray is read as normal, with a normal cardiac silhouette and no pulmonary
infiltrates or effusions. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 10–1.

Pericardial friction rub, finger arthritis, and aphthous ulcers on examination

Changes in the ECG (classically diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions) consistent


No clinical signs of cardiac tamponade (water bottle sign, quiet heart sounds, jugular

venous distension, etc)
Pancytopenia, pyuria, and microhematuria

Most likely diagnosis: Acute pericarditis due to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Best next step: Echocardiogram to assess for effusion and tamponade.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical and ECG features of pericarditis and be able to recog-
nize a pericardial friction rub. (EPA 1, 2, 3)
2. List the causes of pericarditis and its treatment. (EPA 4, 12)
3. List the diagnostic criteria for SLE. (EPA 3, 12)
4. Describe the major complications of SLE and its treatment. (EPA 12)
Considerations
In patients with chest pain, one of the primary diagnostic considerations is always
myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction (MI). This is particularly true when
the ECG is abnormal with changes that may represent myocardial injury, such as
ST-segment elevation. However, other conditions may produce ST-segment eleva-
tion, such as acute pericarditis. ECG findings can help distinguish between these
two diagnoses. Pericarditis may have diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions,
whereas STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) typically will dem-
onstrate ST elevation consistent with an anatomic area of infarction (eg, anterolat-
eral, inferior, posterior, or lateral). The pleuritic nature of the pain and the relief by
leaning forward are clues to the diagnosis. Of the multiple possible etiologies, the
case discloses some features suggestive of SLE.

APPROACH TO:
Acute Pericarditis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE PERICARDITIS: An inflammation of the pericardial sac surrounding
the heart.
PERICARDIAL FRICTION RUB: Harsh, high-pitched, scratchy sound with vari-
able intensity, usually best heard at the left sternal border by auscultation.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO ACUTE PERICARDITIS
Pathophysiology
Acute pericarditis can result from a multitude of disease processes, but the most
common causes are listed in Table 10–1.
Clinical Presentation
There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations for acute pericarditis, ranging
from subclinical inflammation, to the classic presentation of acute pericarditis with
chest pain, to chronic inflammation, which may persist for weeks to months. Most
patients with acute pericarditis seek medical attention because of chest pain. The
classic description is a sudden onset of retrosternal chest pain, which worsens on
inspiration and with recumbence and often radiates to the trapezius ridge; the pain
is improved by sitting and leaning forward. Other clinical features vary according
to the cause of the pericarditis, but most patients are thought to have viral infec-
tion and often present with low-grade fever, malaise, or upper respiratory illness
symptoms.
A pericardial friction rub is pathognomonic and virtually 100% specific for acute
pericarditis. The sensitivity of this sign varies, however, because friction rubs may
soften and return. Classically, a rub is a harsh, high-pitched, scratchy sound with
variable intensity, usually best heard at the left sternal border. It can have one, two,
or three components: presystolic (correlating with atrial systole), systolic, and dia-
stolic. The large majority of rubs are triphasic (all three components) or biphasic,

Diseases of contiguous structures, eg, during transmural myocardial infarction
Hypersensitivity/immunologic reactions, eg, Dressler syndrome
Idiopathic pericarditis: specific diagnosis unidentified, presumably either viral or autoimmune and
requires no specific management
Infectious: viral, bacterial, tuberculous, parasitic
Metabolic disease, eg, uremia, Gaucher disease
Neoplasms: usually thoracic malignancies such as breast, lung, or lymphoma

having a systolic and either an early or a late diastolic component. In these cases, it
usually is easy to diagnose the pericardial friction rub and acute pericarditis. When
the rub is monophasic (just a systolic component), it often is difficult to distinguish
a pericardial friction rub from a harsh murmur, making bedside diagnosis difficult
and uncertain. In these cases, one should look for ECG evidence of pericarditis
(Table 10–2) and perform serial examinations because the rub may vary with time.
The classic ECG findings in acute pericarditis include diffuse ST-segment eleva-
tion in association with PR-segment depression, as seen in this patient. The oppo-
site findings (PR-segment elevation and ST-segment depression) are often seen in
leads aVR and V . Acute pericarditis may be confused with acute MI due to the
1
presentation with chest pain and ST-segment elevation on ECG. This is potentially
a serious problem because if a patient is treated with thrombolytics for infarction,
the patient may develop pericardial hemorrhage and cardiac tamponade. Several
clinical features can help to differentiate the two conditions: Acute ischemia is more
likely to have a gradual onset of pain with a crescendo pattern, more likely to pres-
ent with a heavy pressure or squeezing sensation (as opposed to the sharp pain of
pericarditis), typically does not vary with respiration, and is relieved with nitrates
(whereas the pain of pericarditis is not). In addition, several ECG features can help
to make the distinction (Table 10–2). Moreover, if the ECG reveals arrhythmias or
conduction abnormalities, the condition is much more likely to represent ischemia
rather than pericarditis.
Treatment
Most patients with acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis have excellent progno-
ses. Treatment is mainly symptomatic, with aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as indomethacin, for relief of chest pain.
Colchicine or corticosteroids may be used for refractory symptoms or comor-
bid conditions. In most patients, symptoms typically resolve within days to 2 to
3 weeks. Any form of pericarditis can cause pericardial effusion and bleeding; how-
ever, the most serious consequence would be cardiac tamponade. It is a common
misconception that a pericardial friction rub cannot coexist with an effusion (both
are very common in uremic pericarditis). Therefore, it is important to monitor
these patients for signs of developing hemodynamic compromise resulting from
cardiac tamponade.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
Pathophysiology
Our patient is very young and has no significant previous medical history. The pres-
ence of symmetric arthritis and laboratory findings suggest a systemic disease, such
as SLE, as the cause of her pericarditis. SLE is a systemic inflammatory disease that
mainly affects women. It is characterized by autoimmune multiorgan involvement,
such as pericarditis, nephritis, pleuritis, arthritis, and skin disorders. To diagnose
SLE, the patient must meet 4 of the 11 criteria listed in Table 10–3 (96% sensitive
and 96% specific). The need of 4 out 11 criteria is imperative for the diagnosis of
SLE among patients included in clinical studies; however, it is noteworthy that
patients can actually be diagnosed with SLE even with fewer criteria in the right
clinical context.
Our patient has serositis (pericarditis), oral ulcers, hematologic disorders
(leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia), arthritis, and renal involve-
ment (hematuria)—she clearly meets the clinical criteria for SLE. Although the
patient in the scenario, like most patients with SLE, sought medical attention
because of the pain of arthritis or serositis, both these problems are generally man-
ageable or self-limited. The arthritis is generally nonerosive and nondeforming, and
the serositis usually resolves spontaneously without sequelae.
Complications
The major complication of SLE usually is related to renal involvement, which can
cause hypertension, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, or end-stage renal
disease. In the past, renal disease was the most common cause of death of SLE
patients; however, currently lupus neprhritis can be treated with powerful immu-
nosuppressants, such as high-dose corticosteroids and mycophenolate or cyclo-
phosphamide. Other serious complications of lupus include central nervous system
(CNS) disorders, which are highly variable and unpredictable and can include sei-
zures, psychosis, stroke syndromes, and cranial neuropathies. In addition to renal
failure and CNS involvement, the most common causes of death in SLE patients
are infection (often related to the immunosuppression used to treat the disease)
and vascular disease, for example, MI.
Table 10–3 • DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SLE
Malar rash: fixed erythema, flat or raised over the malar area, that tends to spare nasolabial folds
Discoid rash: erythematous raised patches with adherent keratotic scaling and follicular plugging
Photosensitivity: skin rash as a result of exposure to sunlight
Oral or vaginal ulcers: usually painless
Arthritis: nonerosive, involving two or more peripheral joints with tenderness, swelling,
and effusion
Serositis: usually pleuritis or pericarditis
Renal involvement: persistent proteinuria or cellular casts
Neurologic disorder: seizure or psychosis
Hematologic disorder: hemolytic anemia or leukopenia (< 4000/mm3) on two or more occasions,
or lymphopenia (< 1500/mm3) on two or more occasions, or thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mm3)
Immunologic disorder: positive anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Smith Ab, antiphospholipid Ab
Antinuclear antibody (ANA): positive ANA in absence of drugs known to induce ANA
Abbreviation: Ab, antibody; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
10.1 A 68-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease is admitted to the
hospital for chest pain. On examination, a pericardial friction rub is noted.
His ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation. Which of the following is the
best definitive treatment?
A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
B. Dialysis
C. Steroids
D. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate)
10.2 The patient described in Question 10.1 is hospitalized, but there is a delay
in initiating treatment. You are called to the bedside because he has become
hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 85/68 mm Hg, a heart rate of
122 bpm, and pulsus paradoxus. A repeat ECG is unchanged from admission.
Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate intervention?
A. Draw blood cultures and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics for sus-
pected sepsis.
B. Give intravenous furosemide for fluid overload.
C. Perform echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis.
D. Perform percutaneous coronary intervention for acute MI.
10.3 A 25-year-old woman complains of pain in her PIP and metacarpophalangeal
joints and reports a recent positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) laboratory
test. Which of the following clinical features would not be consistent with a
diagnosis of SLE?
A. Pleural effusion
B. Malar rash
C. Sclerodactyly
D. Urinary sediment with red blood cell casts
ANSWERS
10.1 B. Uremic pericarditis is considered a medical emergency and an indication
for urgent dialysis. While NSAIDs (answer A) can help with pain, they do
not attack the pathophysiologic underlying process. Steroids (answer C) do
not offer benefit in this setting. Resins like sodium polystyrene sulfonate
(answer D) are beneficial in the treatment of hyperkalemia.
11_Toy-IM_Case10_p117-124.indd 123 03/09/20 9:11 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,151,"124 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
10.2 C. The clinical picture suggests the patient has developed pericardial tampon-
ade, which may be life threatening and often requires urgent pericardiocen-
tesis. The question stem does not suggest sepsis or an MI, making answers A
and D incorrect. Furosemide (answer B) can worsen the picture by decreasing
the intravascular compartment further and is therefore contraindicated.
10.3 C. Sclerodactyly, which is thickened and tight skin of the fingers and toes,
is a classic feature of patients with scleroderma (who may also have a posi-
tive ANA test but will likely have either anticentromere or antitopoisomerase
antibodies), but it is not seen in SLE. Malar rash (answer B), serositis, and
glomerulonephritis are typical of SLE but are not seen in scleroderma. The
other answer choices such as pleural effusion (answer A) and red blood cell
casts (answer D) would suggest lupus nephritis are often found in SLE.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Acute pericarditis is characterized by pleuritic chest pain, a pericardial

friction rub, and ECG findings of diffuse ST-segment elevation and PR-
segment depression.
Pericardial friction rub does not exclude a pericardial effusion; patients

with acute pericarditis should be monitored for development of effusion
and tamponade.
Treatment of pericarditis is directed at the underlying cause; for exam-

ple, uremic pericarditis requires urgent dialysis. For viral or inflammatory
causes, treatment is NSAIDs or corticosteroids for refractory cases.
Systemic lupus erythematosus can be diagnosed if a patient has four

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize pericardial tamponade and pulsus paradoxus. (EPA 1, 10)
2. Identify the features of cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, and
restrictive cardiomyopathy and how to distinguish among them. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Understand the treatment of each of these conditions. (EPA 4, 10)
4. Describe the potential cardiac complications of thoracic malignancies and
radiation therapy. (EPA 4, 12)
Considerations
A patient with thoracic malignancy and history of radiation therapy, like this
patient, is at risk for diseases of the pericardium and myocardium. The jugular
venous distention, distant heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus all are suggestive
of cardiac tamponade. The major diagnostic considerations in this case, each with
very different treatment, are pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade, con-
strictive pericarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. All of these conditions can
impede diastolic filling of the heart and lead to cardiovascular compromise. Urgent
differentiation among these conditions is required because the treatment is very
different, and the consequences of mistreating these diseases can be immediately
fatal. Clinically, the patient’s fall in systolic blood pressure with inspiration (pulsus
paradoxus) is suggestive of cardiac tamponade, which would be treated with evacu-
ation of the pericardial fluid via pericardiocentesis.

APPROACH TO:
Cardiac Tamponade
DEFINITIONS
CARDIAC TAMPONADE: Increased pressure within the pericardial space caused
by an accumulating effusion, which compresses the heart and impedes diastolic
filling.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Fluid that fills the pericardial space, which may be
due to infection, hemorrhage, or malignancy. A rapidly accumulating effusion may
lead to cardiac compromise.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Cardiac tamponade refers to increased pressure within the pericardial space caused
by an accumulating effusion, which compresses the heart and impedes diastolic
filling. Because the heart can only pump out during systole what it receives during
diastole, severe restriction of diastolic filling leads to a marked decrease in cardiac
output, culminating in hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, and death. If pericar-
dial fluid accumulates slowly, the sac may dilate and hold up to 2000 mL (produc-
ing notable cardiomegaly on chest x-ray) before causing diastolic impairment. If the
fluid accumulates rapidly, as in a hemopericardium caused by trauma or surgery, as
little as 200 mL can produce tamponade.
Clinical Presentation
The classic description of Beck’s triad (hypotension, elevated jugular venous pres-
sure, and small, quiet heart) is a description of acute tamponade with rapid accu-
mulation of fluid, as in the cases of cardiac trauma or ventricular rupture. If the
fluid accumulates slowly, the clinical picture may look more like heart failure, with
cardiomegaly on chest x-ray (although there should be no pulmonary edema), dys-
pnea, elevated jugular pressure, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema. A high index
of suspicion is required: Cardiac tamponade should be considered in any patient
with hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure.
The most important physical sign to look for in cardiac tamponade is pulsus para-
doxus. This refers to a drop in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during
inspiration. Although called “paradoxical,” this drop in systolic blood pressure is not
contrary to the normal physiologic variation with respiration; it is an exaggeration
of the normal small drop in systolic pressure during inspiration. Although not a
specific sign of tamponade (ie, it is often seen in patients with disturbed intratho-
racic pressures during respiration, eg, those with obstructive lung disease), pulsus
paradoxus is fairly sensitive for hemodynamically significant tamponade.
To test for this, one must use a manual blood pressure cuff that is inflated
above systolic pressure and deflated very slowly until the first Korotkoff sound
is heard during expiration and then, finally, during both phases of respiration.
12_Toy-IM_Case11_p125-132.indd 127 03/09/20 9:31 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,155,"128 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
The difference between these two pressure readings is the pulsus paradoxus. When
the pulsus paradoxus is severe, it may be detected by palpation as a diminution or
disappearance of peripheral pulses during inspiration.
Treatment
Acute treatment of cardiac tamponade consists of relief of the pericardial pres-
sure, by either percutaneous pericardiocentesis (possibly echocardiographically
guided) or a surgical approach. The choice between percutaneous versus surgi-
cal effusion relief is dependent on clinical and institutional expertise. Resection
of the diseased pericardium is the definitive treatment of constrictive pericardi-
tis. There is no effective treatment for restrictive cardiomyopathy. Any patient
with evidence of cardiovascular compromise (ie, cardiac tamponade) should
have immediate drainage of effusion in the pericardium. If there is no evidence
of hemodynamic collapse, then urgent drainage is not necessary. Patients with
large effusions who are hemodynamically stable may require close monitoring,
serial echocardiography, and careful volume status regulation with management
directed to treat the underlying cause of the effusion. Beyond its described thera-
peutic benefit, pericardiocentesis can offer diagnostic value when the presumed
etiology cannot be established.
Complications
Constrictive pericarditis is a complication of a prior episode of acute or chronic
fibrinous pericarditis. The inflammation with resultant granulation tissue forms
a thickened fibrotic adherent sac that gradually contracts, encasing the heart and
impairing diastolic filling. In the past, tuberculosis was the most common cause of
this problem, but now that is a rare cause in the United States. Currently, this is
most commonly caused by radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, or any cause of acute
pericarditis, such as viral infection, uremia, or malignancy. The pathophysiology of
constrictive pericarditis is similar to that of cardiac tamponade in the restricted
ability of the ventricles to fill during diastole because of the thickened noncompli-
ant pericardium.
Because the process is chronic, patients with constrictive pericarditis gener-
ally do not present with acute hemodynamic collapse but rather with chronic and
slowly progressive weakness, fatigue, and exertional dyspnea. Patients commonly
have what appears to be right-sided heart failure, that is, chronic lower extrem-
ity edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites. Like patients with tamponade, they have
elevated jugular venous pressures, but pulsus paradoxus usually is absent. Exami-
nation of neck veins shows an increase in jugular venous pressure during inspira-
tion, termed the Kussmaul sign. This is easy to see because it is the opposite of
the normal fall in pressure as a person inspires. Normally, the negative intratho-
racic pressure generated by inspiration increases blood flow into the heart, but
because of the severe diastolic restriction, the blood cannot enter the right atrium
or ventricle, so it fills the jugular vein. Another physical finding characteristic of
constrictive pericarditis is a pericardial knock, which is a high-pitched, early dia-
stolic sound occurring just after aortic valve closure. Chest radiography frequently
shows cardiomegaly and a calcified pericardium. Table 11–1 compares features of

pericarditis.
Restrictive cardiomyopathy, like the previous diagnoses, is primarily a problem
of impaired diastolic filling, usually with preserved systolic function. This is a rela-
tively uncommon problem in the Western world. The most common causes are amy-
loidosis, an infiltrative disease of the elderly, in which an abnormal fibrillar amyloid
protein is deposited in heart muscle, or fibrosis of the myocardium following radia-
tion therapy or open-heart surgery. In Africa, restrictive cardiomyopathy is much
more common because of a process called endomyocardial fibrosis, characterized by
fibrosis of the endocardium along with fever and marked eosinophilia, accounting
for up to 25% of deaths due to heart disease.
Clinically, it may be very difficult to distinguish restrictive cardiomyopathy from
constrictive pericarditis, and various echocardiographic criteria have been pro-
posed to try to distinguish between them. In addition, magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) can be very useful to visualize or exclude the presence of the thickened
pericardium typical of constrictive pericarditis and absence in restrictive cardiomy-
opathy. Kussmaul sign can be seen in both restrictive cardiomyopathy and constric-
tive pericarditis. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to obtain an endomyocardial
biopsy to make the diagnosis. Differentiation between the two is essential because
constrictive pericarditis is a potentially curable disease, whereas very little effective
therapy is available for either the underlying conditions or the cardiac failure of
restrictive cardiomyopathy.

tory rate of 20 breaths per minute. After examination, the clinician suspects
cardiac tamponade. Which of the following is the most sensitive finding in

11.4 Which of the following is most likely to cause restrictive cardiomyopathy?
A. Endomyocardial fibrosis

D. Doxorubicin therapy
ANSWERS
11.1 A. This patient has shortness of breath and an increase in the jugular venous
pulse with deep inspiration, which is called the Kussmaul sign. This increase
in neck veins with inspiration is seen with constrictive pericarditis (and
restrictive cardiomyopathy) and is due to the impaired diastolic dysfunc-
tion and inability of blood to enter the right ventricle. Normally, the jugular
venous pulse decreases with inspiration since the negative intrathoracic pres-
sure “pulls” the blood into the chest. The other answer choices (B, cardiac
tamponade; C, dilated cardiomyopathy; and D, diabetic ketoacidosis) are not
associated with Kussmaul sign. Cardiac tamponade is associated with a dis-
tended jugular venous pulse at baseline.
11.2 B. Cardiac tamponade is caused by an effusion in the pericardial space that
does not allow for cardiac filling. This patient likely has a pericardial effusion
due to uremia. Pulsus paradoxus is a sensitive yet nonspecific sign for car-
diac tamponade. Other clinical features include hypotension, elevated jugular
venous distention, and soft heart sounds. Answer A (disappearance of radial
pulse during inspiration) is possible in severe tamponade but not common.
Answer C (rise in heart rate more than 20 bpm during inspiration) is not seen
in tamponade. Answer D (distant heart sounds) is found in pericardial effu-
sion with or without tamponade.
11.3 B. Patients with cardiac tamponade are preload dependent; therefore, diuret-
ics (answer A), nitrates (answer C), or morphine (answer D) may cause them
to become hypotensive. In contrast, volume expansion with intravenous flu-
ids helps maintain intravascular volume and cardiac output.
11.4 A. Endomyocardial fibrosis is an etiology of restrictive cardiomyopathy. It is
common in developing countries and is associated with eosinophilia. The other
disease processes mentioned (answer B, viral myocarditis; answer C, beriberi;
and answer D, doxorubicin therapy) are causes of dilated cardiomyopathy.

not have a headache, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea.
He has no significant past medical history. He smokes cigarettes and marijuana
regularly, drinks several beers daily, and denies intravenous drug use.
On examination, his temperature is 102.5 °F, heart rate is 109 beats per minute

examination reveals no abnormalities. His jugular veins show prominent V waves.
He is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and has a harsh holosystolic murmur
at the left lower sternal border that becomes louder with inspiration. Chest
examination reveals inspiratory rales bilaterally. He has linear streaks of induration,
hyperpigmentation, and a few small nodules overlying the superficial veins on
either forearm, but no erythema, warmth, or tenderness.

Although this patient denied intravenous drug use, the track marks on the fore-
arms are very suspicious for intravenous drug abuse. This type of addiction carries
a social stigma, which is the usual reason for patients not to disclose it. A polite,
nonjudgmental approach makes patients more open to discuss this medical prob-
lem. This patient has fever, a new heart murmur very typical of tricuspid regurgita-
tion, and a chest radiograph suggestive of multiple septic pulmonary emboli. Serial
blood cultures, ideally obtained before antibiotics are started, are essential to estab-
lish the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The rapidity with which antibiotics are
started depends on the clinical presentation of the patient: A septic, critically ill

patient needs antibiotics immediately, whereas a patient with a subacute presenta-
tion can wait many hours while cultures are obtained.
APPROACH TO:
Endocarditis
DEFINITIONS
D-DIMERS: Protein fragments present in the blood after a blood clot gets degraded
during fibrinolysis, used for suspicion of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embo-
lism, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
INFECTIOUS ENDOCARDITIS: A microbial inflammation of the endocardium,
usually involving the heart valves.
JANEWAY LESIONS: Painless hemorrhagic macules on the palms and soles
thought to be caused by septic emboli, resulting in microabscesses.
LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT HEPARIN: A class of anticoagulants that works
by activating antithrombin, which decreases factor Xa in the coagulation cascade,
preventing the formation of a clot.
OSLER NODES: Painful, palpable, erythematous lesions most often involving
the pads of the fingers and toes, representing vasculitic lesions caused by immune
complexes.
ROTH SPOTS: Hemorrhagic retinal lesions with white centers thought to be
an immune complex–mediated vasculitis. While this term is widely accepted, the
description of these lesions should actually be attributed not to Roth, but to Litten.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology and Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of infectious endocarditis varies between patients depend-
ing on which valves are involved (left sided vs right sided), as well as the virulence of
the organism. Highly virulent species, such as Staphylococcus aureus, produce a rap-
idly progressive endocarditis. Conversely, less virulent organisms, such as Strepto-
coccus viridans or mutans, produce a more subacute endocarditis, which may evolve
over weeks. Fever is present in 95% of all cases. For acute endocarditis, patients often
present with high fever, acute valvular regurgitation, and embolic phenomena (eg,
to the extremities or to the brain, causing stroke). Subacute endocarditis is more
often associated with constitutional symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, night
sweats, and findings attributable to immune complex deposition and vasculitis;
these include petechiae, splenomegaly, and glomerulonephritis. Classic peripheral
lesions, such as Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, and Roth spots, although frequently
discussed, are seen in only 20% to 25% of cases. Splinter hemorrhages under the
nails may also be seen, but this finding is very nonspecific. A common mnemonic
13_Toy-IM_Case12_p133-142.indd 135 03/09/20 9:23 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,163,"136 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
used to remember the clinical features of bacterial endocarditis is “FROM JANE,”
which stands for fever, Roth spots, Osler nodes, murmur, Janeway lesions, anemia,
nail bed hemorrhage, and emboli.
Right-sided endocarditis usually involves the tricuspid valve, causing pulmo-
nary emboli, rather than involving the systemic circulation. Accordingly, patients
develop pleuritic chest pain, purulent sputum, or hemoptysis, and radiographs may
show multiple peripheral nodular lesions, often with cavitation. The murmur of
tricuspid regurgitation may not be present, especially early in the illness.
In all cases of endocarditis, the critical finding is bacteremia, which usually is
sustained. The initiating event is a transient bacteremia, which may be a result of
mucosal injury, such as a dental extraction, or a complication from the use of intra-
vascular catheters. Bacteria are then able to seed valvular endothelium. Previously
damaged, abnormal, or prosthetic valves form vegetations, which are composed of
platelets and fibrin and are relatively avascular sites where bacteria may grow pro-
tected from immune attack.
An uncommon situation in which routine cultures fail to grow is most likely
a result of prior antibiotic treatment, fungal infection (fungi other than Candida
spp often require special culture media), or fastidious organisms. These organ-
isms can include Abiotrophia spp, Bartonella spp, Coxiella burnetii, Legionella spp,
Chlamydia, and the HACEK organisms (Haemophilus aphrophilus/paraphrophilus,
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens,
Kingella kingae).
Serial blood cultures are the most important step in the diagnosis of endocar-
ditis. Acutely ill patients should have three blood cultures obtained over a 2- to
3-hour period prior to initiating antibiotics. In subacute disease, three blood cul-
tures over a 24-hour period maximize the diagnostic yield. If patients are critically
ill or hemodynamically unstable, initiation of antibiotic therapy should not be
delayed while cultures are obtained. Because sustained bacteremia is the hallmark
of infective endocarditis, blood cultures are commonly positive for microorgan-
isms. Table 12–1 lists typical organisms, frequency of infection, and associated
conditions.
Clinical features and echocardiography are also used to diagnose cases of infec-
tive endocarditis using the highly sensitive and specific Duke criteria. Endocardi-
tis is considered to definitely be present if the patient satisfies two major criteria,
one major and three minor criteria, or five minor criteria (Table 12–2). It should
be noted that transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) rather than transthoracic
echocardiography (TTE) is the method of choice in assessing these vegetations
due to better image quality and fewer intervening structures. If concerns for sys-
temic embolization arise, D-dimer testing is helpful, with an elevated level indicat-
ing significant blood clot formation and breakdown in the body.
Treatment
Antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment is usually begun in the hospital, but because of the
prolonged nature of therapy, it is often completed on an outpatient basis once the
patient is clinically stable. Treatment generally lasts 4 to 6 weeks. If the organism is
susceptible to beta-lactams, such as most Streptococcus species, penicillin G is the

agent of choice. For S. aureus, nafcillin is the drug of choice, often used in combina-
tion with gentamicin, initially for synergy, to help resolve bacteremia. Therapy for
intravenous drug users should be directed against S. aureus. Vancomycin is used
when methicillin-resistant S. aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci are pres-
ent. Ceftriaxone is the usual therapy for the HACEK group of organisms. Decid-
ing appropriate therapy for culture-negative endocarditis may be challenging and
depends on the clinical situation.
Surgery and Anticoagulation. Table 12–3 summarizes the commonly recognized
indications for surgical intervention: valve excision and replacement. For patients
with isolated or newly diagnosed infectious endocarditis, routine anticoagulation
is not recommended unless there is a preexisting or coexisting condition warrant-
ing treatment, such as atrial fibrillation, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary
embolism. At this time, if there are no other contraindications to anticoagulation,
low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, or oral factor Xa inhibitors can be used.
Table 12–2 • DUKE CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOCARDITIS
Major criteria
• Isolation of typical organisms (viridans streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Strep-
tococcus bovis, or one of the HACEK organisms) from two separate blood cultures or persistently
positive blood cultures with other organisms
• Evidence of endocardial involvement: either echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis (eg,
oscillating intracardiac mass) or new valvular regurgitation
Minor criteria
• Predisposing valvular lesion or intravenous drug use
• Fever > 100.4 °F (38 °C)
• Vascular phenomena: arterial or septic pulmonary emboli, mycotic aneurysm, Janeway lesions
• Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots, positive rheumatoid
factor
• Positive blood cultures not meeting major criteria

Table 12–3 • INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF
ENDOCARDITIS
Intractable congestive heart failure caused by valve dysfunction, > 1 serious systemic embolic
episode, or large (> 10 mm) vegetation with high risk for embolism
Uncontrolled infection (eg, positive cultures after 7 d of therapy)
No effective antimicrobial therapy (eg, fungal endocarditis)
Most cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, especially Staphylococcus aureus prosthetic valve infection
Local suppurative complications (eg, myocardial abscess)
Antibiotic Prophylaxis. Patients at high risk for developing infective endocarditis
benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures. The most recent
American Heart Association guidelines (2007) specify individuals the following
conditions
Prosthetic heart valves

Previous infective endocarditis

Congenital heart disease (unrepaired cyanotic coronary heart disease [CHD],

including palliative shunts and conduits)
CHD completely repaired with prosthetic material or a device during the first

6 postoperative months
Repaired CHD with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a pros-

thetic patch or prosthetic device
Valve regurgitation caused by a structurally abnormal valve in cardiac trans-

plant recipients
Amoxicillin is the drug of choice for prophylaxis unless the patient is allergic to
penicillin or unable to take medications by mouth. In these situations, alternative
antibiotics such as cephalosporins and clindamycin can be used.
Complications
One life-threatening complication of endocarditis is congestive heart failure, usually
as a consequence of infection-induced valvular damage. Other cardiac complications
are intracardiac abscesses and conduction disturbances caused by septal involve-
ment by infection. Systemic arterial embolization may lead to splenic or renal
infarction, as well as abscess formation. Vegetations may embolize to the coronary
circulation, causing a myocardial infarction, or to the brain, causing a cerebral
infarction. A stroke syndrome in a febrile patient should always suggest the possi-
bility of endocarditis. Infection of the vasa vasorum may weaken the wall of major
arteries and produce mycotic aneurysms, which occur most commonly in the cere-
bral circulation, sinuses of Valsalva, or abdominal aorta. These aneurysms may leak
or rupture, producing sudden intracranial hemorrhage or exsanguination.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
12.1 A 68-year-old man was hospitalized with persistent fever and a new heart
murmur and diagnosed with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis of the mitral
valve. After receiving 10 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy, he is noted
to be afebrile and with symptoms resolved. At this time, which of the follow-
ing is the most important next step?
A. Good dental hygiene and proper denture fitting to prevent reinfection of
damaged heart valves from oral flora.
B. Repeat echocardiography in 6 weeks to ensure the vegetations have
resolved.
C. Colonoscopy to look for mucosal lesions.
D. Mitral valve replacement to prevent systemic emboli such as cerebral
infarction.
12.2 A 24-year-old intravenous drug user is admitted to the hospital with 4 weeks
of fever. He has three blood cultures positive for growth of Candida species.
After 2 days in the hospital, he develops a cold, blue right great toe. Which of
the following is the appropriate next step?
A. Repeat echocardiography to see if the large aortic vegetation previously
seen has now embolized.
B. Cardiovascular surgery consultation for aortic valve replacement.
C. Aortic angiography to evaluate for a mycotic aneurysm, which may be
embolizing.
D. Switch from fluconazole to amphotericin B.
12.3 A patient with which of the following conditions requires antimicrobial pro-
phylaxis before dental surgery?
A. Atrial septal defect
B. Mitral valve prolapse without mitral regurgitation
C. Previous coronary artery bypass graft
D. Previous infective endocarditis
ANSWERS
12.1 C. Colonoscopy is necessary because a significant number of patients with
S. bovis endocarditis have a colonic cancer or premalignant polyp, which leads
to seeding of the valve by gastrointestinal (GI) flora. Heart valves damaged
by endocarditis are more susceptible to infection, so good dental hygiene
(answer A) is important, but in this case, the organism came from the intes-
tinal tract, not the mouth, and the possibility of malignancy is most impor-
tant to address. Serial echocardiography (answer B) would not add to the
patient’s care after successful therapy because vegetations become organized
and persist for months or years without late embolization. Prophylactic valve
13_Toy-IM_Case12_p133-142.indd 139 03/09/20 9:23 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,167,"140 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
replacement (answer D) would not be indicated because the prosthetic valve is
even more susceptible to reinfection than the damaged native valve and would
actually increase the risk of cerebral infarction or other systemic emboli as a
consequence of thrombus formation, even if adequately anticoagulated.
12.2 B. Fungal endocarditis, which occurs in intravenous drug users or immu-
nosuppressed persons with indwelling catheters, frequently gives rise to
large, friable vegetations with a high risk of embolization (often to the lower
extremities) and is very difficult to cure with medical therapy (antifungal
medications). Valve replacement is usually necessary. Repeat echocardiogra-
phy (answer A) would not add to the patient’s care because the clinical diag-
nosis of peripheral embolization is almost certain, and it would not change
the management. Mycotic aneurysms (answer C) may occur in any artery as a
consequence of endocarditis and can cause late embolic complications, but in
this case, the source probably is the heart. Medical therapy with any antifun-
gal agent (answer D) is unlikely to cure this infection.
12.3 D. Prior endocarditis damages valvular surfaces, and these patients are at
increased risk for reinfection during a transient bacteremia, as may occur dur-
ing dental procedures or some other GI or genitourinary tract procedures. All
of the other conditions mentioned (answer A, atrial septal defect; answer B,
mitral valve prolapse without mitral regurgitation; and answer C, previous
coronary artery bypass graft) have a negligible risk of endocarditis, the same
as in the general population, and antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended
by the American Heart Association.

A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency center (EC) complaining of severe
pain in his left calf and foot that woke him from his sleep. He has a history of
chronic stable angina, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, for which he
takes aspirin, atenolol, and simvastatin. For several years, he has experienced
pain in both calves and feet with walking. The pain has gradually progressed
so that he can now walk only 100 ft before he has to stop. He occasionally has
experienced mild pain in his feet at night, but the pain usually gets better when
he sits up and hangs his feet off the bed. This time, the pain was more severe and
did not improve, and he now feels like the foot is numb, and he cannot move
his toes.
On physical examination, he is afebrile, with a heart rate of 72 beats
per minute (bpm) and a blood pressure of 125/74 mm Hg. Head and neck
examination is significant for a right carotid bruit. His chest is clear to
auscultation; his heart rhythm is regular with a nondisplaced apical impulse,
an S gallop, and no murmurs. His abdomen is benign, with no tenderness or
4
masses. He has bilateral femoral bruits, and his femoral and popliteal pulses
are palpable bilaterally. His pedal pulses are diminished; they are present on
the right but absent on the left. The left distal leg and foot are pale and cold to
touch, with very slow capillary refill.

Limb Ischemia (Peripheral Vascular Disease)
Summary: A 58-year-old man presents with
Severe pain and numbness of his left foot

Angina and a carotid bruit suggesting systemic atherosclerotic disease

Femoral bruits bilaterally and bilateral calf claudication


Most likely diagnosis: Acute limb ischemia, either thrombotic arterial occlusion or
embolism from a more proximal source.
Next step: Angiogram of the lower extremity.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the clinical presentation of a patient with atherosclerotic periph-
eral vascular disease, including acute limb ischemia. (EPA 1)
2. Describe the evaluation and medical management of peripheral vascular dis-
ease. (EPA 3, 4)
3. Understand the indications for extremity revascularization. (EPA 4, 10, 12)
Considerations
This patient has diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease, including coronary artery
disease, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease. His history of calf pain with
ambulation and resolution with rest is classic for claudication. Recently, the perfusion
of his left leg likely was worsening, requiring his waking up and dangling his leg to
enable blood flow and to help the pain. Rest pain is a warning sign of possible criti-
cal limb vascular insufficiency. The patient complains of the sudden onset of pain,
pallor, and pulselessness, indicative of acute arterial occlusion. His limb ischemia
may result from acute arterial occlusion caused by an embolus possibly originating
from a thrombus in the heart, the aorta, or a large proximal artery such as the iliac.
Magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) angiography, or pos-
sibly a conventional arteriogram, would be needed to first determine the arterial
anatomy and define the best mode of revascularization. Then, depending on the
level of occlusion, the patient may require urgent arterial thromboembolectomy.

APPROACH TO:
Peripheral Vascular Disease
DEFINITIONS
ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX (ABI): Ratio of ankle to brachial systolic blood
pressure, determined clinically or by using Doppler ultrasound flow. Normal ratio
is 0.9–1.4.
CLAUDICATION: Pain, ache, or cramp in muscles that increases with walking or
leg exertion in a predictable manner and resolves with rest.
“6 P’s” OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE: Pain, pallor, paresthesia, poiki-
lothermia (coolness), pulselessness, and paralysis.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Although atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, clinicians often focus on the cor-
onary circulation and pay less attention to the extremities. Yet, atherosclerotic
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is estimated to affect up to 16% of Americans
who are 55 years and older and may exist without clinically recognized coronary or
cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, PAD confers the same risk of cardiovascular
death as in persons with a prior myocardial infarction or stroke. The most impor-
tant risk factors for PAD are cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus. Hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and elevated homocysteine levels also play significant roles.
Less common causes of chronic peripheral arterial insufficiency include throm-
boangiitis obliterans, or Buerger disease, an inflammatory condition of small- and
medium-sized arteries that may affect the upper or lower extremities. It is found
almost exclusively in smokers, especially men younger than 40 years. Fibromuscular
dysplasia is a hyperplastic disorder affecting medium and small arteries that usually
occurs in women. Generally, the renal or carotid arteries are involved, but when the
arteries to the limbs are affected, the clinical symptoms are identical to those of ath-
erosclerotic PAD. Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory condition, seen primarily
in younger women, that usually affects branches of the aorta, most commonly the
subclavian arteries, and causes arm claudication and Raynaud phenomenon, along
with constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss.
Patients with chronic peripheral arterial insufficiency who present with sudden
unremitting pain may have an acute arterial occlusion, most commonly the result of
embolism or in situ thrombosis. The heart is the most common source of emboli; condi-
tions that may cause cardiogenic emboli include atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomy-
opathy, and endocarditis. Artery-to-artery embolization of atherosclerotic debris from
the aorta or large vessels may occur spontaneously or, more often, after an intravascu-
lar procedure, such as arterial catheterization. Emboli tend to lodge at the bifurcation
of two vessels, most often in the femoral, iliac, popliteal, or tibioperoneal arteries. Arte-
rial thrombosis may occur in atherosclerotic vessels at the site of stenosis or in an area
of aneurysmal dilation, which may also complicate atherosclerotic disease.

Case Files Internal Medicine,173,"146 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Clinical Presentation
Patients with acute arterial occlusion may present with a number of signs, which
can be remembered as six P’s: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesias, poikilother-
mia (coolness), and paralysis. The first five signs occur fairly quickly with acute isch-
emia; paralysis will develop if the arterial occlusion is severe and persistent.
The most common symptom associated with chronic arterial insufficiency
caused by PAD is intermittent claudication (pain, achiness, fatigue, or other dis-
comfort that occurs in one or both legs during exercise and is relieved with rest). It
is ischemic pain and occurs distal to the site of the arterial stenosis, most commonly
in the calves. The symptoms often are progressive and may severely limit a patient’s
activities and reduce the patient’s functional status. An individual with proximal
stenosis, such as aortoiliac disease, may complain of exertional pain in the buttocks
and thighs. Severe occlusion may produce rest pain, which often occurs at night
and may be relieved by sitting up and dangling the legs, using gravity to assist blood
flow to the feet.
On physical examination, palpation of the peripheral pulses may be diminished
or absent below the level of occlusion; bruits may indicate accelerated blood flow
velocity and turbulence at the sites of stenosis. Bruits may be heard in the abdomen
with aortoiliac stenosis and in the groin with femoral artery stenosis. Elevation of
the feet above the level of the heart in the supine patient (known as the Buerger
test) often induces pallor in the soles. If the legs are then placed in the dependent
position, they frequently develop rubor as a result of reactive hyperemia. Chronic
arterial insufficiency may cause hair loss on the legs and feet, thickened and brittle
toenails, and shiny atrophic skin. Severe ischemia may produce ulcers or gangrene,
typically at the distal extremities.
When PAD is suspected, the test most commonly used to evaluate for arterial
insufficiency is the ABI. Systolic blood pressures are measured by Doppler ultra-
sonography in each arm and in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries in
each ankle. Normally, blood pressures in the large arteries of the legs and arms
are similar. In fact, blood pressures in the legs often are higher than in the arms
because of an artifact of measurement, so the normal ratio of ankle-to-brachial pres-
sures is 0.9–1.4. Patients with claudication typically have ABI values ranging from
0.41 to 0.90, and those with critical leg ischemia have ABI values less than or equal
to 0.40. Further evaluation with exercise treadmill testing can clarify the diagnosis
when symptoms are equivocal, allow for assessment of functional limitations (eg,
maximal walking distance), and evaluate for concomitant coronary artery disease.
Additional imaging, such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed
tomography angiography (CTA), is not used in routine diagnostic evaluation but
can help determine arterial anatomy before a revascularization procedure.
Treatment
The goals of therapy include reductions in cardiovascular morbidity, improvement
in quality of life by alleviating symptoms, and preservation of limb viability.
Risk Factor Modification. The first step in managing patients with PAD is risk
factor modification. Because of the likelihood of coexisting atherosclerotic vascular
disease such as coronary artery disease, patients with symptomatic PAD have an
14_Toy-IM_Case13_p143-152.indd 146 03/09/20 9:23 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,174,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 147
estimated mortality rate of 50% in 10 years, most often as a consequence of cardio-
vascular events. Smoking is, by far, the single most important risk factor impacting
both claudication symptoms and overall cardiovascular mortality. Besides slowing
the progression to critical leg ischemia, tobacco cessation reduces the risk of fatal or
nonfatal myocardial infarction by as much as 50%, more than any other medical or
surgical intervention. In addition, treatment of hypercholesterolemia, control of
hypertension and diabetes, and use of antiplatelet agents such as aspirin or clopido-
grel all have been shown to improve cardiovascular health and may have an effect on
peripheral arterial circulation. Carefully supervised exercise programs can improve
muscle strength and prolong walking distance by promoting the development of
collateral blood flow.
Medications for Claudication. Specific medications for improving claudication
symptoms have been used with some benefit. Pentoxifylline, a substituted xanthine
derivative that increases erythrocyte elasticity, has been reported to decrease blood
viscosity, thus allowing improved blood flow to the microcirculation; however,
results from clinical trials are conflicting, and the benefit of pentoxifylline, if pres-
ent, appears small. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with vasodilatory and
antiplatelet properties, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
for treatment of claudication. It has been shown in randomized controlled trials to
improve maximal walking distance and quality of life. Figure 13–1 shows an algo-
rithm for management of PAD.
Revascularization. Patients with critical leg ischemia, defined as ABI less than
0.40, severe or disabling claudication, unremitting rest pain, or nonhealing ulcers,
should be evaluated for a revascularization procedure. This can be accomplished
by percutaneous angioplasty, with or without placement of intra-arterial stents, or
surgical bypass grafting. Angiography (either conventional arteriogram or MRA)
should be performed to define the flow-limiting lesions prior to any vascular proce-
dure. Ideal candidates for arterial revascularization are those with discrete stenosis
of large vessels; diffuse atherosclerotic and small-vessel disease responds poorly.
Managing acute arterial occlusions. Rapid restoration of arterial supply is manda-
tory in patients with an acute arterial occlusion that threatens limb viability. Initial
management includes anticoagulation with heparin to prevent propagation of the
thrombus. The affected limb should be placed below the horizontal plane without
any pressure applied to it. Conventional arteriography is used to identify the loca-
tion of the occlusion and to plan for the method of revascularization. Surgical
removal of an embolus or arterial bypass may be performed, particularly if a large
proximal artery is occluded. A balloon catheter may also be used to remove the clot.
Alternatively, a catheter can be used to deliver intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy
directly into the thrombus, sometimes in conjunction with stent placement. In
comparison to systemic fibrinolytic therapy, localized infusion is associated with
fewer bleeding complications.

ANSWERS
13.1 D. Tobacco cessation is the most important intervention to improve cardio-
vascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients, such as those with
PAD, and to improve claudication symptoms. Cilostazol (answer C) may
help with claudication symptoms but will not affect cardiovascular mortal-
ity. Aspirin (answer A), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-
hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors
are important adjuncts for risk factor modification and for relief of symp-
toms, but their benefits pale in comparison to smoking cessation.
13.2 C. Thromboangiitis obliterans, or Buerger disease, is a disease of young male
smokers and may cause symptoms of chronic arterial insufficiency in either
legs or arms. Cholesterol embolisms (answer A) are most likely to occur after
a vascular procedure, including cardiac catheterization. Location of arterial
insufficiency is also important for differentiation of the cause. For example,
fibromuscular dysplasia (answer B) is more likely to involve the renal arter-
ies and extracranial cerebrovascular arteries rather than peripheral arteries of
the extremities. Takayasu arteritis (answer D) is a large-vessel vasculitis that
primarily affects the aorta and the primary branches.
13.3 D. Takayasu arteritis is associated with symptoms of inflammation such as
fever, and it most often affects the subclavian arteries, producing stenotic
lesions that may cause unequal blood pressures, diminished pulses, and isch-
emic pain in the affected limbs. The other answer choices typically do not
cause fever.
13.4 A. Embolism of cholesterol and other atherosclerotic debris from the aorta or
other large vessels to small vessels of skin or digits may complicate any intra-
arterial procedure. Signs may include livedo reticularis, ulcers, gangrene, renal
involvement, and ocular involvement. Eosinophilia may be found on labora-
tory work. The other answer choices may be associated with pain, but not
sudden onset of ischemia.
13.5 A. Surgical therapy is reserved for those with severe symptoms after exercise
despite pharmacologic agents or in cases where quality of life is impaired.
Pain at rest (answer B), refractoriness to medical therapy (answer C), and the
presence of nonhealing ulcers and/or gangrene (answer D) are some indica-
tions for surgical intervention. Duplex ultrasound can help discern whether
the patient is a potential surgical candidate. Arteriography may also be per-
formed. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease is a contraindication for surgery since
bypass would not help in the face of significant and widespread disease.

A 48-year-old woman is brought to the emergency center complaining of a sudden
onset of dyspnea. She reports that she was standing in the kitchen making dinner
when she suddenly felt as if she could not get enough air. Also, her heart started
racing, she became light-headed, and she felt as if she would faint. She denies
chest pain or cough. Her medical history is significant only for a cholecystectomy
performed 2 weeks earlier for gallstones. The procedure was complicated by a
wound infection, requiring her to stay in the hospital for 8 days. She takes no
medications regularly and only takes acetaminophen as needed for pain at her
abdominal incision site.
On examination, she is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min,
oxygen saturation of 84% on room air, heart rate of 124 beats per minute (bpm),
and blood pressure of 118/89 mm Hg. She appears uncomfortable, diaphoretic,
and frightened. Her oral mucosa is slightly cyanotic, her jugular venous pressure
is elevated, and her chest is clear to auscultation. Her heart rhythm is tachycardic
but regular with a loud second sound in the left second intercostal space,
without gallop or murmurs. Her abdominal examination is benign, with a clean
incision site without signs of infection. Her right leg is moderately swollen from
her midthigh to her foot, and her thigh and calf are mildly tender to palpation.
Laboratory studies, including cardiac enzymes, are normal; her electrocardiogram
(ECG) reveals only sinus tachycardia, and her chest x-ray is interpreted as normal.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the factors that predispose patients to develop thromboembolic
disease. (EPA 12)
2. Recognize the clinical presentation of PE. (EPA 1, 2)
3. Describe the strategies to diagnose PE. (EPA 3)
4. Understand the goals and methods of treatment of thromboembolism.
(EPA 4, 10, 12)
Considerations
Pulmonary embolism is a difficult diagnosis to establish because of the nonspeci-
ficity of presenting signs and symptoms and the probabilistic nature of the most
common noninvasive diagnostic tests. In patients with suspected PE, initial treat-
ment is supportive to maintain adequate oxygenation and hemodynamic stabil-
ity while efforts are undertaken to diagnose the cause of the patient’s symptoms.
Often, a series of diagnostic tests is necessary to determine the likely diagnosis.
Specific treatment of PE may include thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy for
unstable patients and initiation of anticoagulation as a long-term measure to pre-
vent recurrence.

APPROACH TO:
Pulmonary Embolism
DEFINITIONS
D-DIMER: A major fibrin degradation product that is released upon fibrinolysis.
Elevated plasma levels of D-dimer indicate recent or ongoing intravascular coagula-
tion and fibrinolysis.
DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT): Blood clot in the deep venous system
that usually affects the lower extremities or pelvic veins.
LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT HEPARIN (LMWH): A fragment of the larger
mucopolysaccharide, heparin, that activates antithrombin III, inhibiting the final
common pathway of the coagulation cascade.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM: A clot (usually originating from the lower extrem-
ity veins) that travels through the venous circulation and becomes lodged in the
pulmonary artery or one of its branches. PE causes acute pulmonary hypertension
and is labeled “massive PE” if it causes hemodynamic instability; it is labeled
“submassive” or “moderate” if it causes right ventricular enlargement, strain, or dys-
function but is not associated with hemodynamic instability.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Diagnosis and management of PE require a combination of clinical suspicion and
appropriate use of diagnostic tools. Pulmonary emboli usually arise from DVTs and
occasionally from less common sources, including air, fat, amniotic fluid, or tumor
thrombus. More than 100 years ago, Rudolf Virchow postulated three factors that
predispose to venous thrombus: local trauma to vessel wall, a state of hypercoagula-
bility, and venous stasis. Genetic predisposition to hypercoagulability accounts for
approximately 20% of PEs. The most common inherited conditions are the factor V
Leiden mutation and the prothrombin gene mutations. Malignancy is also a predis-
posing condition for DVT. Neoplastic cells are thought to generate thrombin or
to synthesize various procoagulants. Surgery and prolonged immobilization also
increase the risk of PE up to 1 month postoperatively.
Pathophysiology
When venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they may embolize to
the pulmonary arteries, causing PEs. The deep proximal lower extremity veins are
the most common sites of clot formation, although thromboses in pelvic, calf, and
upper extremity veins may also embolize. Emboli to the pulmonary artery cause vas-
cular obstruction and release of vasoactive agents such as serotonin, thereby elevating
pulmonary vascular resistance. The resulting increase in alveolar dead space and
subsequent redistribution of blood flow create areas of V/Q mismatch and impair
gas exchange. Reflex bronchoconstriction increases airway resistance. This cascade
15_Toy-IM_Case14_p153-162.indd 155 03/09/20 9:22 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,183,"156 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
can result in pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or loss of surfactant, further decreas-
ing lung compliance. As pulmonary vascular resistance increases, right heart wall
tension rises, resulting in dilation and dysfunction that ultimately may impair left
heart function. Progressive right heart failure is the usual cause of death from PE.
Clinical Presentation
Physical Examination. PE can often mimic other cardiopulmonary diseases, making
the diagnosis challenging. Acute onset of dyspnea is the most common symptom of
PE, and tachypnea is the most frequently observed sign. Severe dyspnea accompa-
nied by syncope, hypotension, or cyanosis may indicate massive PE, whereas pleu-
ritic pain, cough, or hemoptysis may suggest a smaller, more peripheral embolus
causing infarction of lung tissue. Classic findings on physical examination include
tachycardia and signs of right ventricular dysfunction, including increased jugu-
lar venous pressure, accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound,
and systolic murmur that increases with inspiration. Findings suggestive of DVT
include pain, swelling, and erythema of the lower extremity, particularly the back of
the leg below the knee. Some patients complain of calf tenderness.
D-dimer Test. The most useful nonimaging diagnostic test is the serum D-dimer
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). It is elevated (> 500 ng/mL) in
more than 95% of patients with PE, reflecting the breakdown of fibrin and throm-
bolysis. Although the D-dimer ELISA has a high negative predictive value and thus
is useful in excluding PE, one should keep in mind that it lacks specificity if the
pretest probability of PE is low. Elevations may be seen in patients with myocardial
infarction, pneumonia, heart failure, cancer, or sepsis. Additional laboratory tests
can assist in risk stratification of submassive PE, including brain natriuretic pep-
tide (BNP) and cardiac troponins. Abnormalities on the ECG are less useful in the
evaluation of PE. The most common finding is sinus tachycardia. The S Q T
1 3 3
(S wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III, respec-
tively) is often discussed but seen only in a minority of patients. When present, it
is relatively specific.
Imaging Modalities. Radiologic studies are critical in the diagnosis of PE and
DVT. A chest x-ray is the first study indicated in a symptomatic patient with new-
onset dyspnea. A normal or near-normal chest x-ray is the most common finding in
PE, sometimes with nonspecific abnormalities, such as atelectasis. In general, acute
onset of hypoxemia in a patient with a normal chest x-ray should be interpreted
as PE until otherwise proven. Classic abnormalities associated with PE include
Westermark sign (decreased pulmonary vascularity distal to the clot), Hampton
hump (peripheral wedge-shaped density above the diaphragm), and Palla sign
(enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery). The chest radiograph
probably is more important in identifying other significant pulmonary parenchy-
mal disease (pneumonia, pulmonary edema) and cardiac disease (cardiomyopathy)
as alternative causes of the respiratory symptoms.
For any imaging modality, the most accurate diagnosis will be achieved in
combination with the clinical suspicion. The Wells score is a useful clinical
calculator to clinically estimate pretest probability of PE. A point score less
than 4 with a negative D-dimer assay indicates a low probability for PE. A score

of 2 to 6 points indicates moderate probability, and more than 6 points is high
probability (Table 14–1).
Chest computed tomography angiogram (CTA) with intravenous contrast is now
the principal imaging modality to diagnose suspected PE. Current-generation spiral
CT can acquire high-resolution images in a single breath hold and can visualize
small branch artery emboli. In addition, the chest CT has the additional benefit
of visualizing other abnormalities, such as pneumonia, aortic abnormalities, or
pulmonary masses, that may not have been apparent on routine chest radiograph
and may provide an alternative diagnosis for the patient’s symptomatology. The
main caveats in the use of CT are the image quality and the experience of the
center in interpreting this type of scan. In general, however, CT has been shown
to be at least as accurate as the previously accepted standard imaging modality,
V/Q lung scanning.
In patients in whom a CT with radiocontrast cannot be obtained or is contrain-
dicated (such as in cases of advanced renal insufficiency or severe contrast allergy),
a V/Q scan remains a useful tool. This study evaluates the circulation of air (distri-
bution of inhaled xenon-133) and blood (distribution of technetium-99 aggregates
with albumin) in the lungs. A segmental or lobar area with proper air distribution
but with no perfusion is diagnostic of PE. A normal scan or a low-probability scan
with a low clinical suspicion for PE effectively excludes the diagnosis.
If the CT and/or V/Q scan are nondiagnostic and yet the clinical suspi-
cion remains high, other imaging modalities may be obtained. A lower extrem-
ity venous ultrasound demonstrating an acute DVT in a patient with signs and
symptoms of PE would be sufficient to diagnose and treat PE (especially since the
treatment with anticoagulation is the same). It should be noted, though, that a
normal ultrasound does not exclude the diagnosis of PE since most patients with
PE do not have evidence of residual DVT and since in many cases the clot has
already embolized.

Other imaging studies, such as contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) or echocardiography (especially transesophageal echocardiography) may
be used when the clinical suspicion remains high, but other diagnostic studies are
inconclusive. Pulmonary artery angiography used to be the gold standard, but the
methods described previously are as sensitive, specific, and less invasive; thus, it is
no longer preferred. Figure 14–1 shows a diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE.
Treatment
Treatment options can be categorized in terms of primary and secondary therapy
based on different management goals. Primary therapy consists of clot dissolu-
tion or thrombolysis (with tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]) or removal of the clot
by surgical embolectomy. Primary therapy is usually reserved for patients with a
high risk for adverse outcomes if the clot remains, that is, those with evidence of
right heart failure or hemodynamic instability. The main criterion for thrombolytic
administration is a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg in the absence of absolute
contraindications to tPA. The main complications of thrombolytic administration
are bleeding, a very small percentage of which can be devastating intracerebral hemor-
rhages. Patients who have conventional surgical embolectomy performed emergently
for “rescue” have a higher mortality (approaching 50%); however in less urgent cir-
cumstances, mortality rates are about 7%.
Newer therapies include half-dose thrombolytics and catheter-directed thrombol-
ysis for submassive PE. Patients with hemodynamic collapse may require mechani-
cal circulatory support with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
15_Toy-IM_Case14_p153-162.indd 158 03/09/20 9:22 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,186,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 159
(ECMO), which provides cardiac and pulmonary support, but this should only be
employed in patients who are likely to improve with a definitive therapy (ie, surgical
embolectomy).
For patients who are normotensive with normal RV function, the treatment
is with anticoagulation, with the goal of secondary prevention of thrombus exten-
sion or recurrence. Anticoagulation does not dissolve an existing thrombus, but it
allows for endothelialization and organization, which begins within days of treat-
ment. Immediate anticoagulation should be initiated with intravenous unfraction-
ated heparin (UFH), subcutaneous LMWH (eg, enoxaparin or tinzaparin), or the
direct factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux. While UFH requires a continuous infusion
and frequent laboratory monitoring every 4 to 6 hours, LMWH and fondaparinux
have similar efficacy and safety profiles. Both LMWH and fandaparinux provide
rapid onset of action and predictable dose response, and laboratory monitoring is
generally not required. Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs),
which include direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and Xa inhibitors (rivar-
oxaban, apixaban and edoxaban), are now approved for the treatment of DVT and
also do not require laboratory monitoring.
While patients are still on heparin, they can start therapy with the oral vitamin K
antagonist warfarin. Because its biological effect is unpredictable, warfarin requires
routine monitoring of the prothrombin time, standardized across laboratories as
the international normalized ratio (INR). The target therapeutic INR is usually
2–3. When initiating warfarin therapy, the usual course is to use UFH, LMWH,
or fondaparinux for at least 5 days while overlapping with warfarin (commonly
referred to as “bridging”) until the INR has been therapeutic for 2 consecutive days.
Rivaroxaban and apixaban have the added advantage that a bridging dose of hepa-
rin is not required.
The duration of treatment relates to the risk of recurrence. One factor in assess-
ing this risk is whether the DVT or PE was provoked (ie, occurred due to a readily
identifiable and transient event, eg, trauma or surgery) or unprovoked. For pro-
voked DVT of the calf or upper extremity, 3 months of anticoagulation are recom-
mended. Six months are recommended for patients with provoked proximal leg
DVT or PE. For patients with idiopathic or unprovoked DVT or PE or with ongo-
ing risk factors, such as malignancy or antiphospholipid syndrome, the duration of
therapy is controversial, but indefinite anticoagulation may be required.
Inferior vena cava filter placement to prevent recurrent PE is recommended
when there is active bleeding or other contraindication to anticoagulation or when
there is recurrent DVT or PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation.

ANSWERS
14.1 C. Tachypnea is the most common physical sign associated with PE. Calf or
thigh pain and/or swelling (answer D) occurs less frequently than tachypnea.
Other common clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolus in decreasing
frequency include pleuritic pain, cough, and orthopnea. Wheezing (answer A),
a sound caused by narrowing of the airway as seen in asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), can occur in PE but is less common.
15_Toy-IM_Case14_p153-162.indd 160 03/09/20 9:22 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,188,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 161
Rales (answer E) are rattling or crackling noises heard on auscultation of the
lungs due to fluid or exudate in the alveoli. It is an uncommon sign in patients
with PE. An increased pulmonary component of S (answer B) is also a pos-
2
sible sign in PE due to increased pressures in the pulmonary vasculature, but
it is not the most common sign.
14.2 C. Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common hereditary thrombophilia.
It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and therefore will affect
both men and women. The other answer choices (answer A, protein S defi-
ciency; answer B, antithrombin III deficiency; answer D, antiphospholipid
antibody syndrome; and answer E, familial malignancy syndrome) are all
causes of hereditary thrombophilia with increased risk of PE but are less
common causes.
14.3 E. This patient likely has cervical cancer with significant vaginal bleeding and
anemia. This is a relative contraindication for anticoagulation (answers A
[intravenous UFH]; answer B [fractionated subcutaneous heparin]; answer C
[subcutaneous UFH]; and answer D [oral warfarin]) since these agents would
exacerbate the bleeding. Thus, a vena cava filter is the most appropriate choice
in this patient; the filter ideally prevents thrombi from traveling to the lungs.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Acute onset of dyspnea or hypoxemia with a normal chest x-ray should
»
be considered caused by a PE until proven otherwise.
Diagnosis of PE is usually established using imaging tests such as chest
»
CT pulmonary angiogram in light of clinical pretest probability.
The clinical suspicion guides the pursuit of diagnosis of thromboemboli.

The primary therapy of DVT or PE is anticoagulation, with the goal of pre-

venting recurrence.

A 58-year-old man comes to your office because of shortness of breath. He has
experienced mild dyspnea on exertion for a few years, but more recently he has
noted worsening shortness of breath with minimal exercise and the onset of
dyspnea at rest. He has difficulty reclining; as a result, he spends the night sitting
up in a chair trying to sleep. He reports a cough with production of yellowish-
brown sputum every morning throughout the year. He denies chest pain, fever,
chills, or lower extremity edema. He has smoked about two packs of cigarettes
per day since age 15. He does not drink alcohol. A few months ago, the patient
went to an urgent care clinic for evaluation of his symptoms, and he received a
prescription for some inhalers, the names of which he does not remember. He
was also told to find a primary care provider for further evaluation. On physical
examination, his blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 96 beats per
minute (bpm), respiratory rate is 28 breaths/min, and temperature is 97.6 °F. He is
sitting in a chair, leaning forward, with his arms braced on his knees. He appears
uncomfortable, with labored respirations and cyanotic lips. He is using accessory
muscles of respiration, and chest examination reveals wheezes and rhonchi
bilaterally, but no crackles are noted. The anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the
chest wall appears increased, and he has inward movement of the lower rib cage
with inspiration. Cardiovascular examination reveals distant heart sounds but
with a regular rate and rhythm, and his jugular venous pressure (JVP) is normal.
His extremities show no cyanosis, edema, or clubbing.

ANSWERS TO CASE 15:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Summary: A 58-year-old man presents with
Worsening shortness of breath with minimal exercise and the onset of dyspnea at rest

with difficulty reclining
History of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day since age 15

Reports of a productive cough with yellowish-brown sputum every morning through-

out the year
Sitting in a characteristic “tripod” position to facilitate use of accessory muscles of

respiration
The appearance of an airway obstruction with respiratory distress, lower chest retrac-

tions, and bilateral wheezes and rhonchi
Perioral cyanosis suggesting hypoxemia

An increased appearance of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest wall

Most likely diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute
exacerbation.
Next diagnostic steps: Arterial blood gas (ABG) to assess oxygenation and acid-
base status and chest x-ray.
Best initial treatment: Oxygen by nasal cannula, followed closely by bronchodilators
and steroids for airway inflammation.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Define chronic bronchitis, COPD, and emphysema. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Describe spirometry and flow-volume loops and their value for the diagnosis
and management of obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. (EPA 3)
3. Describe the treatment of stable COPD, as well as management of acute exac-
erbations, including the indications for mechanical ventilation. (EPA 4, 10, 12)
Considerations
This 58-year-old, long-time smoker likely has COPD. He is now in respiratory
distress with labored respirations, cyanosis, and wheezing. The urgent issue is his
current respiratory status. Rapid clinical assessment is critical in case this patient
is headed toward respiratory failure, perhaps necessitating endotracheal intubation
and mechanical ventilation. An ABG will quickly provide information regarding
the adequacy of oxygenation status (Pao ) and ventilation (Paco ). A chest x-ray
2 2
will determine the underlying status of the lung parenchyma and whether a trigger
for the current situation can be identified.

APPROACH TO:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
DEFINITIONS
CHRONIC BRONCHITIS: COPD component that is diagnosed clinically and is
characterized by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and productive cough for
3 months or more in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease
that might account for this symptom.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD): Chronic air-
flow obstruction caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema. COPD is a prevent-
able and treatable disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is
usually progressive and associated with enhanced chronic inflammatory response
in the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Diagnosis in the right clinical setting is
usually supported by FEV /FVC ratio less than 0.7. Severity of COPD on spirom-
1
etry is based on the level of FEV /FVC ratio compared to the predicted value. The
1
severity of airflow limitation can be classified based on postbronchodilator FEV
1
(Table 15–1).
EMPHYSEMA: COPD component that inferred clinically, and is diagnosed patho-
logically with abnormal, permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal
bronchioles, with destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis.
FEV /FVC: Ratio involving volume expired in the first second and the vital
1
capacity (VC) in maximal effort, reduced in obstructive lung disease.
FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV ): Volume of air
1
expired in the first second during maximal expiratory effort. FEV is reduced in
1
both obstructive lung disease (increased airway resistance) and restrictive lung dis-
ease (low VC).
FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC): Total volume of air expired after full inspi-
ration. FVC is reduced in restrictive lung disease.
OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE: Chronic pulmonary disorder that is charac-
terized by a disproportional decrease in maximal airflow from the lung in relation

to maximal volume that can be displaced from the lung. Typically, FEV will be
1
decreased relative to FVC; therefore, the FEV /FVC will be decreased. The most
1
common types of obstructive lung disease are asthma and COPD.
PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT): Complete PFTs comprise respiratory
tests of spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion.
RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE: Chronic pulmonary disorder characterized
by low lung volumes. Can be due to intrinsic factors, such as changes in the lung
parenchyma, or extrinsic factors, such as alterations of the chest wall, pleura, or
respiratory muscles. Typically, the FVC and FEV are reduced, but the FEV /FVC
1 1
is normal. The diagnosis is best made by a reduced total lung capacity (TLC).
SPIROMETRY: Method of evaluating respiratory flow volumes and flow rates to
assess pulmonary function.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
The most common etiology for COPD is inhalation injury, specifically cigarette
smoking. Another important cause is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is hered-
itary; pulmonary disease may become evident by age 40 and may occur without
cough or smoking history. Therapy by replacement of alpha-1 antitrypsin enzyme
is available. Characteristically, patients with COPD present with progressively
worsening dyspnea (first on exertion, then with activity, then at rest). Patients may
vary in appearance from a “blue bloater” (chronic bronchitis, overweight, edema-
tous, cyanotic) to a “pink puffer” (emphysema, thin, ruddy cheeks).
Arterial blood gases often are normal in the early phase of the disease; however,
in more advanced disease, there is evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia, often
with a chronic compensated respiratory acidosis as a consequence of CO reten-
2
tion. Such chronic stable patients may have a Pao near 50 mm Hg and a Paco
2 2
near 50 mm Hg, but a near-normal pH (the “50-50” club). During an acute exac-
erbation, more severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia, or respiratory acidosis noted on
ABG, may be an indication of impending respiratory failure and need for ventila-
tory support. Given an appropriate clinical context, general indications for measur-
ing ABGs include low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (< 92%), depressed
level of consciousness, acute exacerbation, or assessment of hypercapnia in at-risk
patients 30 to 60 minutes after supplemental oxygen is initiated.
Spirometry is the most basic, inexpensive, widely valuable PFT to diagnose
pulmonary diseases (Figure 15–1). Spirometric tracings of forced expiration
(Figure 15–2) and flow-volume loops (Figure 15–3) help to identify the type of
lung disease (obstructive vs restrictive), as well as potential reversibility of airflow
obstruction. Restrictive lung diseases tend to have lower lung volumes (decreased
TLC and VC), whereas obstructive diseases have larger lung volumes (TLC normal
or increased) with decreased expiratory flow rates (reduced FEV < 80% expected,
1
and FEV /FVC < 0.7). Specific parameters help to classify the type and degree of
1
lung dysfunction (Table 15–2). Reduced FEV /FVC with minimal response to
1
bronchodilators is the hallmark of COPD.

Treatment
Management of severe COPD exacerbations focuses simultaneously on relieving
airway obstruction and correcting life-threatening abnormalities of gas exchange.
Bronchodilators (beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents) are administered via
handheld nebulizers; systemic glucocorticoids accelerate the rate of improvement
in lung function among these patients. Antibiotics should be given if there is suspi-
cion of a respiratory infection. Controlled oxygen administration with nasal oxygen
at low flows or oxygen with Venturi masks will correct hypoxemia without causing
severe hypercapnia. It is prudent to watch for CO retention and consequent apnea

intubation and mechanical ventilation in the treatment of cooperative patients
with an acute exacerbation of COPD and severe hypercapnia. Signs of acute respi-
ratory failure include tachypnea (respiratory rate > 40 breaths/min), inability to
speak because of dyspnea, accessory muscle use with fatigue despite maximal ther-
apy, confusion, restlessness, agitation, lethargy, a rising Paco level, and extreme
2
hypoxemia. Acute respiratory failure is generally treated with endotracheal intu-
bation and mechanical ventilatory support to correct the gas exchange disorders.
Complications of mechanical ventilation include difficulty in extubation, ventilator-
associated pneumonia, and pneumothorax.
Other therapies such as inhaled bronchodilators (beta-agonists and/or anticho-
linergics) or inhaled glucocorticoids are used for symptomatic relief and to reduce
the frequency of exacerbations. Therapeutic recommendations are based on the
disease stage, per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) guidelines (Table 15–3).

Complications
Long-term complications of COPD from hypoxemia can cause pulmonary hyper-
tension, secondary erythrocytosis, exercise limitation, and impaired mental func-
tioning. For patients with COPD who are stable, only smoking cessation,
supplemental oxygen therapy for patients with chronic hypoxemia, and lung volume
reduction surgery in selected patients have been shown to alter the natural history of
the disease and provide a reduction in mortality. Patients with resting hypoxemia
(Pao < 55 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation [Sao arterial oxygen saturation]
2 2
< 88%) generally benefit from home oxygen therapy, which must be utilized at least
18 h/d.

15.3 Which of the following therapies is most likely to provide the greatest benefit
to a patient with chronic stable emphysema and a resting oxygen saturation
of 86%?
A. Inhaled tiotropium daily
B. Inhaled albuterol as needed
C. Oral prednisone daily
D. Supplemental oxygen used at night
E. Supplemental oxygen used continuously
ANSWERS
15.1 A. COPD is characterized by chronic airway obstruction, with most airflow
resistance occurring in small airways of the lower respiratory tract, producing
expiratory wheezing. Inspiratory stridor (answer D) would occur with upper
airway, usually extrathoracic, obstruction. Clubbing (answer B) is not gener-
ally a feature of COPD unless there is long-standing cyanosis and should
prompt investigation for another disease process, such as a bronchogenic car-
cinoma. Crackles and elevated JVP (answer C), as well as an S (answer E),
3
are signs of heart failure.
15.2 D. This patient likely has COPD, based on the smoking history and symp-
toms. A decrease in the FEV /FVC ratio is the hallmark of airflow obstruc-
1
tion. The FEV is decreased in obstructive and restrictive lung disease, and
1
therefore answer C (normal FEV ) is incorrect. The diffusing capacity is typi-
1
cally decreased (answer A) in COPD as well as intrinsic restrictive lung dis-
ease. The DLCO indicates the adequacy of the alveolar-capillary membrane;
the residual volume is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maxi-
mal expiratory effort and is usually increased (answer B) in COPD due to air
trapping. The FVC is typically normal to increased with COPD, which is why
answer E is incorrect.
15.3 E. For patients with chronic hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen has a signifi-
cant impact on mortality, with a greater benefit with continuous usage rather
than intermittent or nocturnal-only usage (answer D). Bronchodilators such
as tiotropium (answer A) and albuterol (answer B) improve symptoms and
FEV but offer no mortality benefit. Chronic use of oral corticosteroids
1
(answer C) should be avoided because of unfavorable side effects, such as
osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Patients with obstructive lung disease have airflow limitation on expira-

tion (reduced FEV /FVC), whereas patients with restrictive lung disease
1
have difficulty in expanding their lung volumes in response to exercise
(reduced TLC).
The mainstay for treatment of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodi-

lators, oxygen, and glucocorticoids, as well as antibiotics if infection is
suspected.
Controlled supplemental oxygen along with positive pressure mask ven-

tilation (BiPAP) may prevent respiratory failure requiring endotracheal
intubation.
Smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen to treat chronic hypoxemia

are the only medical therapies shown to decrease mortality among per-
sons with COPD.
In both obstructive and restrictive lung disease, the FEV is decreased;
» 1
the FEV/FVC is decreased in obstructive processes and normal in restric-
1
tive processes.
The hallmark of restrictive lung disease is decreased lung capacity,

A 37-year-old man presents to your office with a complaint of cough. The cough
began approximately 3 months prior to this appointment, and it has become
progressively more annoying to the patient. The cough is nonproductive and
worse at night and after exercise. The patient has had a sedentary lifestyle but
recently started an exercise program, including jogging, and he says he is having
a much harder time with exertion. He “runs out of breath” earlier than he did
previously and “coughs a lot”. He has not had any fever, blood-tinged sputum, or
weight loss. He denies nasal congestion and headaches. He does not smoke and
has no significant medical history. His examination is notable for a blood pressure
of 134/78 mm Hg and lung findings of occasional expiratory wheezes on forced
expiration. A chest radiograph is read as normal.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Discuss the differential diagnosis of chronic cough in adult patients. (EPA 2)
2. Understand the stepwise approach to finding the cause of cough in these
patients. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Recognize how to diagnose and treat asthma. (EPA 3, 4)
Considerations
This is a 37-year-old man who presents with a chronic cough of more than 8 weeks’
duration. With the history of exercise intolerance, worsening cough at night, and
occasional wheezes on examination, asthma is the most likely diagnosis in this
patient. A chest radiograph is important to evaluate for other processes such as
tumor, infection, or other etiologies of lung injury. A focused history should look
for exposure to environmental irritants, medications such as angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or other etiologies such as postnasal drip or gastro-
esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

APPROACH TO:
Chronic Cough
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE COUGH: Cough lasting less than 3 weeks, most commonly caused by
acute upper respiratory infection but may also be caused by heart failure, pneumo-
nia, allergic rhinitis, or exacerbation of existing structural lung disease.
ASTHMA: Condition of bronchial hyperactivity and smooth muscle hypertrophy
leading to a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways associated with wide
spread bronchospasm that has characteristically reversible obstruction on pulmo-
nary function tests.
CHRONIC COUGH: Cough that often lasts more than 8 weeks. In a smoker,
chronic cough is usually a symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but
bronchogenic carcinoma would be in the differential diagnosis in this population.
In a nonsmoker with a normal chest radiograph and absence of ACE inhibitor use,
it may be due to upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), which is usually due to
postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS), GERD, or asthma.
SUBACUTE COUGH: Cough that is typically defined as lasting 3 to 8 weeks in
duration and is most often infectious or postinfectious in etiology. Infectious eti-
ologies of subacute cough include bacteria and viruses, such as respiratory syncytial
virus, influenza, and adenovirus. Bacterial infections causing subacute cough are
usually due to pertussis, Chlamydia, or mycoplasma.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Chronic cough is a common complaint and accounts for a large portion of health
care expenditures. Physiologically, cough is a reflexive defense mechanism to clear
the upper airways. The action of a cough serves two main functions: (1) to protect
the lungs against aspiration and (2) to clear secretions or other material into more
proximal airways to be expectorated from the tracheobronchial tree. Evaluation
begins with a detailed history and physical examination, including smoking habits,
complete medication list, environmental and occupational exposures, and any his-
tory of lung disease. Specific questions regarding the precipitating factors and dura-
tion and nature of the cough should be elicited. Although the physical examination
or nature of the cough rarely identifies the cause, meticulous review of the ears,
nose, throat, and lungs may suggest a particular diagnosis. For example, a cobble-
stone appearance of the oropharynx (representing lymphoid hyperplasia) or boggy
erythematous nasal mucosa can be consistent with UACS. End-expiratory wheez-
ing suggests active bronchospasm, whereas localized wheezing may be consistent with
a foreign body or a bronchogenic tumor.
In more than 90% of cases, a normal chest radiograph in an immunocompetent
nonsmoker guides the clinician to one of three diagnoses: UACS, asthma, or GERD.

Chronic cough in an immunocompromised patient is beyond the scope of this dis-
cussion. In the outpatient setting, the mainstay of diagnosis relates to the response
with empiric therapy, and multiple etiologies (UACS and GERD) are often simul-
taneously addressed. Often, a definitive diagnosis for chronic cough depends on
observing a successful response to therapy. A rational approach includes discontin-
uing an ACE inhibitor if the patient is using one, obtaining a chest radiograph, and
avoiding environmental irritants. If persistent, then UACS, asthma, and GERD
should be considered. Referral to a pulmonologist is recommended when the diag-
nostic and empiric therapy options are exhausted. If suspicion for carcinoma is
high, a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax or bron-
choscopy should be pursued. A diagnosis of psychogenic cough should be one of
exclusion. See Figure 16–1 for an example of an algorithm.
Upper Airway Cough Syndrome
Upper airway cough syndrome can be attributed to sinusitis and the following
types of rhinitis, alone or in combination: nonallergic, allergic, postinfectious, vaso-
motor, drug induced, and environmental irritant induced. Since the symptoms may
be nonspecific (eg, frequent throat clearing, nasal discharge, or sensation of liquid
in the throat), no definitive diagnostic criteria exist for UACS, and response to
therapy confirms the diagnosis. Initial treatment for a nonallergic etiology usu-
ally includes combination treatment with a first-generation antihistamine and a
decongestant for 3 weeks. For allergic rhinitis, a newer-generation antihistamine,
along with a nasal corticosteroid, should be used. If the patient’s symptoms do
not improve, sinus radiographs may be ordered. Opacification, air-fluid levels, or
mucosal thickening could suggest sinusitis, which can be treated with antibiotics
when indicated.
Asthma
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by air
way obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and mucus hypersecretion with
recurring symptoms. These symptoms are often reversible spontaneously or with
treatment.
Although wheezing is considered a classic sign of asthma, cough is often the only
symptom. Cough-variant asthma usually presents with a dry cough that occurs
throughout the day and night, and is worsened by airway inflammation from viral
infections of the upper respiratory tract, allergies, cold air, or exercise. Although the
history may be suggestive of asthma, the diagnosis should be confirmed with pul-
monary function tests. Spirometry can confirm airflow obstruction with reduced
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) and FEV /forced vital capacity (FVC);
1 1
spirometry will also demonstrate reversibility with improved FEV after inhalation
1
of a bronchodilator, typically a beta-agonist. Positive bronchodilator responsive-
ness is defined as reversible obstruction with an increase in FEV or FVC of more
1
than 12% and an increase of 200 mL of volume after bronchodilator treatment. If
the diagnosis is in doubt, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (the fundamental patho-
physiologic abnormality in asthma) can be confirmed by a reduction in FEV after

1
management is stepwise with use of asthma controllers such as inhaled corticoste-
roids (and if needed systemic corticosteroids), which inhibit airway inflammation,
and bronchodilators for rapid relief of symptoms. Current guidelines emphasize a
preventive approach and a stepwise approach to therapy based on asthma severity
and control (Table 16–1).
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
Gastroesophageal reflux disease often can be clinically inapparent. It may be the
primary or coexisting cause of the cough, such as the result of aspiration and vagal
stimulation. Initial treatment includes lifestyle modification along with medical
17_Toy-IM_Case16_p173-182.indd 178 03/09/20 9:21 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,206,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 179
therapy. Recommendations include a low-fat diet, elevation of the head of the bed,
avoidance of offending foods (caffeine, alcohol, chocolate), smoking cessation, and
weight reduction. If the cough does not resolve with lifestyle changes, daily treat-
ment should be initiated with an H receptor antagonist, such as famotidine, or a
2
proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole. If acid suppression does not resolve
the symptoms and if there are other symptoms of dyspepsia, a gastric motility stim-
ulant such as metoclopramide may be considered.
Patients who remain symptomatic after maximal medical treatment may benefit
from 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring to confirm the diagnosis. An esophago-
gastroduodenoscopy showing esophagitis or an upper gastrointestinal radiographic
series demonstrating reflux further supports the diagnosis. Of note, gastrointesti-
nal symptoms may resolve prior to resolution of the cough, and full resolution may
require 2 to 3 months of intensive medical therapy.

A. Cough caused by captopril may resolve with switching to enalapril.
B. Initial treatment of a chronic cough should include codeine or a similar
opiate derivative to suppress the cough.

cough for the past 6 weeks, but no shortness of breath. On physical examina-
tion, her lungs are clear to auscultation, and she has bilateral pretibial tender
erythematous raised nodules. Which of the following is your best next step?
A. Chest radiograph
B. High-resolution CT
C. Empiric treatment for postnasal drip
D. Antinuclear antibody test

16.4 An obese 50-year-old man with a history of asthma is being seen in the clinic
with complaints of occasional dyspepsia and nocturnal cough. He notes that
he wakes up in the morning with a sour taste in his mouth. His current medi-
cations include an inhaled corticosteroid and a short-acting beta-2-agonist.
Which of the following should be your next step?
A. 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring
B. Chest radiograph
C. Initiation of omeprazole
D. Short course of oral corticosteroids
E. Initiation of allergy desensitization
ANSWERS
16.1 C. Long-acting beta-2-agonists are indicated in this situation. The asthma
would be classified as moderate persistent because of the exacerbations
more than once a week and nocturnal symptoms more than once a week;
the recommended treatment is addition of LABAs (such as salmeterol) to
the inhaled corticosteroids. LABA therapy is particularly helpful with noc-
turnal symptoms. The logical augmentation therapy following guidelines
makes the other options (answer A, oral steroids; answer B, leukotriene
inhibitors; and answer D, theophylline) less useful (see Table 16–1). This
patient does not show signs of GERD, so answer E (antireflux therapy) is
not the best choice.
16.2 D. Often, more than one condition is responsible for causing chronic cough
in a given patient. Cough from ACE inhibitors (answer A) is class dependent,
and change to another class of antihypertensives is more appropriate. The
etiology of chronic cough should be determined prior to suppression of the
cough (answer B) because treatment of the underlying condition is the most
effective approach. A patient with GERD (answer C) may present with the
sole manifestation of cough, sometimes with no perceivable acid reflux.
16.3 A. The patient has clinical features suggestive of sarcoidosis given the new
cough, arthralgias, and description of erythema nodosum. The initial, most
cost-effective study is a chest radiograph. Hilar lymphadenopathy with
17_Toy-IM_Case16_p173-182.indd 180 03/09/20 9:21 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,208,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 181
or without interstitial infiltrates would solidify a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
A high-resolution CT (answer B) may be ordered if the patient has inter-
stitial lung disease, but it is not the first study of choice. Treating postnasal
drip (answer C) does not investigate the patient’s other symptoms. An anti-
nuclear antibody test (answer D) would not necessarily identify the cause of
the cough or provide a diagnosis. Antituberculosis therapy (answer E) is indi-
cated in a patient with suspected tuberculosis. The clinical presentation of
tuberculosis includes fever, night sweats, productive or bloody cough, weight
loss, and exposure to a patient with tuberculosis.
16.4 C. The dyspepsia and the sour taste suggest GERD. Omeprazole is an oral
proton pump inhibitor, which is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the H+-K+-
ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) pump in parietal cells and is useful in
patients with GERD. Aside from acid suppression, other recommendations
include dietary modifications and weight reduction. Esophageal pH monitor-
ing for 24 hours (answer A) is indicated only if there is no response to treat-
ment, and it is not indicated initially. Chest radiography (answer B) is only
indicated if there are symptoms of cough or aspiration such as pneumonia.
Answer D (short course of oral corticosteroids) is indicated with an acute
exacerbation that does not respond to nebulized beta-adrenergic agonist
therapy. Answer E (allergy desensitization) is indicated with patients with
moderate-to-severe asthma when there is evidence of allergic reaction to vari-
ous antigens.
CLINICAL PEARLS
A normal chest radiograph excludes most, but not all, of the serious and
»
uncommon causes of chronic cough.
The three most common causes of chronic cough in immunocompetent
»
nonsmokers who are not taking ACE inhibitors are UACS, asthma, and
GERD.
Cough caused by ACE inhibitors can be triggered after the first dose or
»
may occur after months of therapy.
Treatment of asthma is a stepwise process based on frequency of symp-
»
toms and response to prescribed medications.
Asthma can be the cause of cough in a patient with a normal examina-
»
tion and pulmonary function tests. If suspicion is high, a positive metha-
choline challenge has a high predictive value.
Definitive diagnosis of the etiology of chronic cough is not always neces-
»
sary for successful treatment.

A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency center complaining of a
productive cough, fever, and chest pain for 4 days. She was seen 2 days ago in
her primary care provider’s clinic with the same complaints; she was diagnosed
clinically with pneumonia and was sent home with oral azithromycin. Since then,
her cough has diminished in quantity. However, the fever has not abated, and she
still experiences left-sided chest pain, which is worse when she coughs or takes a
deep breath. In addition, she has started to feel short of breath when she walks
around the house. She has no other medical history. She does not smoke and
has no history of occupational exposure. She has not traveled outside of the
United States and has no sick contacts.
On physical examination, her temperature is 103.4 °F, heart rate is 116 beats
per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 128/69 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is
24 breaths/min and shallow. Her pulse oximetry is 94% saturation on room air.
Physical examination is significant for decreased breath sounds in the lower half
of the left lung fields posteriorly, with dullness to percussion between the fifth
and eighth intercostal spaces at the midclavicular line. There are a few inspiratory
crackles in the midlung fields, and her right lung is clear to auscultation. She has
sinus tachycardia with no murmurs. She has no cyanosis. Figure 17–1 shows her
chest x-ray films.

ANSWERS TO CASE 17:
Pleural Effusion, Parapneumonic
Summary: A 32-year-old previously healthy woman presents with
A 4-day history of productive cough, fever, and chest pain

Clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, not improved with oral

azithromycin
Vital signs: febrile, tachycardic, tachypneic with hypoxemia on room air

Diminished breath sounds and left-sided dullness to percussion

Chest radiography confirming a large left-sided pleural effusion

Effusion that is likely caused by infection in the adjacent lung parenchyma and that

may be the cause of her failure to improve on antibiotics
Most likely diagnosis: Parapneumonic effusion as a complication of pneumonia.
Next step: Diagnostic thoracentesis to help diagnose the cause of the pleural effu-
sion and to determine the necessity for fluid drainage.
Most common causes: Underlying pneumonia, malignancy, pulmonary embolism,
tuberculosis.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the use of Light criteria to distinguish transudative effusions from
exudative effusions as a guide to the etiology of the effusion. (EPA 1, 3)
2. Describe the pleural fluid characteristics that suggest a complicated parapneu-
monic effusion or empyema and the need for drainage. (EPA 3, 4)
3. State the treatment of a complicated parapneumonic effusion that does not
improve after thoracentesis. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
If the pleural effusion is large and free flowing, which can be evaluated with a lat-
eral decubitus film, then diagnostic thoracentesis can easily be accomplished. It is
important to determine if the effusion is, in fact, caused by the pneumonia, and, if
so, whether it is likely to resolve with antibiotics alone or will require drainage with
tube thoracostomy.

APPROACH TO:
Pleural Effusion
DEFINITIONS
EMPYEMA: Collection of pus in the pleural cavity.
EXUDATE: Effusion caused by inflammatory or malignant causes, with high pro-
tein or high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.
PLEURAL EFFUSION: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
TRANSUDATE: Effusion caused by alteration of hydrostatic and oncotic forces,
with low protein and low LDH levels.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Pleural effusions occur in 40% of patients with an underlying bacterial pneumonia.
Most of these effusions should resolve with appropriate antibiotic treatment, but
if the fluid characteristics predict a “complicated” parapneumonic effusion, urgent
tube drainage is indicated to prevent formation of fibrous peels, which may need
surgical decortication.
Diagnostic thoracentesis should be considered for every patient who presents
with a pleural effusion with unknown cause. An exception to this rule is if the
patient is known to have heart failure (HF) with equal bilateral effusions or if the
effusion is too small—that is, less than 10 mm—on lateral decubitus film. However,
if the pleural effusion of HF does not significantly improve after a trial of diure-
sis, a diagnostic thoracentesis should be performed. Another exception would be in
patients with fluid overload states, such as in end-stage renal disease or nephrotic
syndrome, where dialysis will help with the clearing of effusions. Table 17–1 gives

the correlations of pleural fluid appearance. As little as 5 to 10 mL can be visual-
ized on a lateral decubitus film (it is more reliable in detecting smaller effusions),
and fluid volume more than 500 mL usually obscures the whole hemidiaphragm.
Ultrasound is an additional tool that can be easily used to identify pleural
effusions.
Transudate Versus Exudate. Transudative and exudative fluids can be differ-
entiated by the amount of measured protein and LDH, which correlate with the
pathophysiology of the fluid formation. Approximately 12 mL of pleural fluid
is formed every day by the parietal pleural capillaries and absorbed also by the
parietal pleura (lymphatics). Processes that disturb this equilibrium lead to fluid
accumulation. Clinical settings in which the hydrostatic pressure is increased
(HF and constrictive pericarditis), the oncotic pressure is decreased (nephrotic
syndrome and cirrhosis), or the intrapleural pressure is reduced (atelectasis),
lead to the formation of a “transudate.” In contrast, “exudates” are more a result
of local inflammation and increased capillary permeability—for example, infec-
tion, malignancy, and connective tissue diseases, which cause proteins to leak
into the pleural space. Less commonly, impaired lymphatic drainage, as occurs
in chylothorax or lymphangitic spread of a malignancy, may cause an exudative
fluid. Pulmonary emboli can cause both exudative and transudative effusions
(exudative is much more common). Tables 17–2 and 17–3 list the etiologies of
transudative and exudative pleural effusions, respectively.
Light Criteria. The most widely used criteria to distinguish between a transuda-
tive and exudative fluid are the Light criteria first described in 1997. For a fluid to
be labeled an exudate, it must meet at least one of the following criteria (transudates
meet none of these criteria):
1. Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio > 0.5
2. Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio > 0.6
3. Pleural fluid LDH > 2/3 the upper limit of normal for serum LDH
Pleural LDH correlates with the degree of pleural inflammation and, along with
fluid protein, should always be sent in the initial evaluation.

and small-cell carcinoma); usually indicative of very poor prognosis
Connective tissue disease Rheumatoid pleurisy: very low glucose, rheumatoid factor > 1:320

Lupus Lupus pleuritis: lupus erythematosus cells are highly specific; pleu-
ral fluid/serum antinuclear antibody > 1.0; usually responsive to
steroid treatment
Pancreatitis Elevated pancreatic amylase isoenzyme; salivary isoenzyme seen in
esophageal rupture with associated low pH
Chylothorax Triglycerides > 110 mg/dL
Asbestos exposure Spectrum of disease ranges from pleural plaques to effusion and
malignancy; may be eosinophilic
Treatment
In contrast to the simple “diagnostic” thoracentesis that can be performed to evalu-
ate the contents of the fluid, a “therapeutic” thoracentesis may also be performed
if the patient is dyspneic as a result of a significant amount of fluids. The purpose
is to remove large volumes of fluid (up to 1.5 L) for patient comfort and clinical
improvement. Of note, removal of large amounts of fluid puts the patient at risk for
developing reexpansion pulmonary edema.
If tube thoracostomy drainage is required, a chest tube is placed until the
drainage rate has decreased to less than 50 mL/d. Postdrainage imaging must be
obtained to confirm complete drainage of fluid and to assess the need for placement
of a second tube if the fluid has not been adequately drained (as is often seen if the
effusion is loculated). The following fluid characteristics suggest the need for chest
tube drainage:
Most sensitive: pH < 7.20 (normal pH 7.6)

Positive Gram stain or culture of fluid

Presence of loculations

Empyema (frank pus in the pleural space)

Glucose less than 60 mg/dL

LDH more than 1000 U/L

18_Toy-IM_Case17_p183-192.indd 188 03/09/20 9:21 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,216,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 189
If the patient does not meet the criteria for immediate drainage, a 1-week trial
of antibiotics is indicated, with close reevaluation of those patients who do not
respond or who clinically deteriorate.
In empyema, 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy are necessary for complete ster-
ilization. Poorly draining or multiloculated empyemas are treated further by
administering a combination of fibrinolytic agents such as tissue plasminogen acti-
vator (tPA) and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) through the chest tube. Video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery with debridement and drainage is the next option if the
combination of tPA and DNase fail in clearing the loculations. Thus, surgical refer-
ral is encouraged within a week of failure of medical therapy (tube thoracostomy
with or without tPA and DNase).

17.3 A 69-year-old man is being seen in the emergency center for gradually wors-
ening dyspnea and a nagging cough over the past 3 months. He denied feeling
warm or having fever. The chest radiograph shows a right-sided pleural effu-
sion. A diagnostic thoracentesis reveals gross blood in the fluid. Which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Parapneumonic effusion
B. Malignancy in the pleural space
C. Rupture of aortic dissection into the pleural space
D. Pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction
ANSWERS
17.1 B. Heart failure is commonly associated with bilateral pleural effusions,
which are transudative, as a consequence of alteration of Starling forces. The
effusions of heart failure are best managed by treating the heart failure, for
example, with diuretics, and typically do not require thoracentesis. Per Light
criteria, the other answer choices would be classified as an exudative pleural
effusion. Exudative effusion criteria include pleural fluid: serum protein > 0.5;
pleural fluid: serum LDH > 0.6; and pleural fluid LDH > 2/3 upper limits
for serum.
17.2 C. Drainage with chest thoracostomy is the best treatment for this patient.
The positive Gram stain, low pH, low glucose, and markedly elevated LDH all
suggest that this parapneumonic effusion is “complicated,” that is, it is unlikely
to resolve with antibiotic therapy; this effusion is likely to produce loculated
pockets of pus, which will require drainage with tube thoracostomy. While
continuing the therapy with antibiotics (answer B) is appropriate, it is also
insufficient in the case of an empyema, which is the situation at present with
this patient. Answer A (Send the fluid for culture) is usually performed, but
it often is negative for growth; although antibiotics and culture are important
adjuvant measures, the most important intervention is fluid drainage. Answer D
(Schedule a follow-up chest x-ray in 2 weeks) is inappropriate and will lead
to patient decompensation.
17.3 B. The most common causes of hemorrhagic pleural effusion are trauma,
malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism (answer D)
would be suggested by acute onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain rather
than this subacute presentation. Aortic rupture (answer C) can produce a
hemothorax but would have an acute presentation with chest and back pain
and hemodynamic compromise. Parapneumonic effusion (answer A) is a col-
lection of purulent fluid that arises from pneumonia, lung abscess, or bron-
chiectasis; the aspirated fluid would be purulent and not bloody.

A 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency center after coughing up
several tablespoons of bright red blood. For the previous 3 to 4 months, she has
had a chronic nonproductive cough but no fevers. More recently, she has noticed
some scant blood-streaked sputum. She also reports increased fatigue, decreased
appetite, and a 25-lb weight loss in the past 3 months. She denies chest pain,
fever, chills, or night sweats. The patient drinks two martinis every day and has
smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years. Other than alcohol
and tobacco use, she has not had any additional medical issues. She worked in a
library for 35 years and has no history of occupational exposures. She does not
take any medication except for one low-dose aspirin per day.
The patient is a mildly anxious appearing, thin woman who is alert and oriented.
Her blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 88 beats per minute (bpm),
respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min, and temperature is 99.2 °F. Neck examination
reveals no lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or carotid bruit. The chest has scattered
rhonchi bilaterally, with no wheezes or crackles. Cardiovascular examination
reveals a regular rate and rhythm, without rubs, gallops, or murmurs. The abdomen
is benign with no hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of her extremities reveals no
cyanosis; there is finger clubbing. Neurologic examination is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 18:
Hemoptysis/Lung Cancer
Summary: A 68-year-old woman presents with
A history of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years

A chronic, nonproductive cough with recent blood-streaked sputum

Increased fatigability, reduced appetite, and 3 months of unintentional weight loss

Absence of fever, chills, and night sweats

Physical examination revealing scattered rhonchi bilaterally and digital clubbing

Next step: Chest imaging, either x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan.
Most likely diagnosis: Lung cancer is the most likely diagnosis due to the presence
of hemoptysis, unintentional weight loss, and clubbing of the fingers in an indi-
vidual with significant smoking history.
Major risk factor: Smoking, especially for longer than 30 years.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the differential diagnosis for hemoptysis. (EPA 2, 10)
2. Be familiar with the risk factors for and the clinical presentation of lung
cancer (including superior vena cava [SVC] syndrome and Horner syndrome).
(EPA 1, 3, 12)
3. Know the workup of the solitary pulmonary nodule. (EPA 3)
4. List the general principles of the treatment of lung cancer. (EPA 4, 9)
Considerations
The most likely diagnosis in this case is lung cancer. On physical examination, there
is finger clubbing, which is an enlargement of the terminal digital phalanges with
loss of the nail bed angle. In pulmonary disease, clubbing of the fingers is most com-
monly seen in patients with lung cancer, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, or chronic
septic conditions, such as bronchiectasis or lung abscess. This patient will require
imaging studies such as a chest x-ray and likely CT of the chest and, if abnormali-
ties are seen, a biopsy procedure to establish a tissue diagnosis. In the meantime,
she will benefit from rest and cough suppression to minimize her hemoptysis,
which may be acutely life threatening if massive bleeding occurs. Though it may
not affect prognosis, it is advisable that she also stop smoking at this time.

APPROACH TO:
Hemoptysis and Lung Cancer
DEFINITIONS
HORNER SYNDROME: Symptoms are ptosis, loss of pupillary dilation (miosis),
and loss of sweating on the ipsilateral side (anhidrosis) caused by compression of
the superior cervical ganglion and resultant loss of sympathetic innervation. This is
usually related to a superior sulcus tumor.
HEMOPTYSIS: An expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract.
MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS: A consensus definition has not been established but
typically is defined as 250 mL or more of fresh blood coughed up in 24 hours.
SUPERIOR VENA CAVA (SVC) SYNDROME: Obstruction of venous drainage,
usually by extrinsic compression of the SVC, leading to edema of the face, neck,
and upper part of the torso, and formation of prominent collateral veins on the
upper chest.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO HEMOPTYSIS
Pathophysiology
Hemoptysis is an alarming symptom, both because it may be a manifestation of a
serious underlying diagnosis, such as malignancy, and because massive hemopty-
sis itself can be deadly by filling up alveolar air spaces and causing asphyxiation.
Hemoptysis, particularly if in large amounts or recurrent, is a potentially fatal
event, thus requiring an immediate search for the cause and precise location of the
bleeding. Hemoptysis must be differentiated from hematemesis and epistaxis. Cur-
rently, the most common causes of hemoptysis in the United States are bronchitis and
lung cancer. In prior eras, the most common causes have been tuberculosis, lung
abscess, and bronchiectasis. As stated previously, a good history is an important
diagnostic step: Blood-streaked purulent sputum suggests bronchitis; chronic copi-
ous sputum production suggests bronchiectasis. Hemoptysis with an acute onset of
pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea suggests a pulmonary embolism.
Clinical Presentation
History. A targeted history for patients presenting with hemoptysis is an essential
diagnostic step, as it may direct the subsequent steps. It is important to discern
how much blood has been expectorated in the past 24 hours and how often the
hemoptysis as occurred. These questions are essential in evaluating the acuity and
severity of the hemoptysis and may prompt additional questions, such as whether
the patient’s airway needs to be protected emergently. It is also necessary to probe
about a past history of chronic respiratory disease or respiratory problems (chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, interstitial lung
fibrosis, recurrent pneumonia). Specific lung diseases may predispose to bronchi-
ectasis and to airway diseases more prone to hemoptysis. Questions regarding an
19_Toy-IM_Case18_p193-202.indd 195 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,223,"196 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
infectious etiology are also imperative. Is the blood mixed with phlegm? Is that
sputum clear or purulent? Additionally, fevers, chills, and night sweats may lead
to either an infectious or malignant root cause depending on severity and fre-
quency. Smoking history and environmental exposures should also be assessed.
These questions should be followed up by asking about degree and duration of
exposure.
Physical examination. Examination of a patient can reveal many cues regarding
what the underlying diagnosis may be. When presenting with hemoptysis, the lung
examination is of particular importance, but additional hints may be supplied by
a complete physical examination. Pulmonary examination may reveal rhonchi
or low-pitched continuous sounds that suggest secretions in the airway, and/or
wheezes or high-pitched continuous sounds with a hissing quality that suggest nar-
rowed airways. Crackles (rales) are considered intermittent discontinuous sounds
and may point to several different ailments, such as heart failure, pneumonia, bron-
chitis, or bronchiectasis. Clubbing of the fingers is defined as enlargement of the
terminal digital phalanges with loss of the nail bed angle. In pulmonary disease,
clubbing of the fingers is most commonly seen in patients with lung cancer, inter-
stitial pulmonary fibrosis, or chronic septic conditions, such as bronchiectasis or
lung abscess.
Laboratory Tests/Imaging. Every patient with hemoptysis should undergo a
chest x-ray or CT to look for a mass lesion, evidence of bronchiectasis, or paren-
chymal lung disease. If the chest imaging reveals a lung mass, the patient should
undergo fiber-optic bronchoscopy to localize the site of bleeding and to visualize
and attempt to biopsy any endobronchial lesion.
Treatment
Patients with massive hemoptysis require urgent measures to maintain their airway
and to prevent spilling of blood into unaffected areas of the lungs. These patients
should be kept at rest with cough suppressants. If the bleeding is localized to one
lung, the affected side should be placed in a dependent position so that bleed-
ing does not flow into the contralateral side. They may also require endotracheal
intubation and rigid bronchoscopy for better airway control and suction capac-
ity. Urgent referral to interventional radiology for bronchial artery embolization or
thoracic surgery for resection may also be required if bleeding is not amenable to
bronchoscopic intervention.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO LUNG CANCER
Pathophysiology
Primary lung cancer, or bronchogenic carcinoma, is the leading cause of cancer
deaths in both men and women. Approximately 85% of lung cancers of all cell
types are linked to smoking. Of the 15% of lung cancers that are not related to
smoking, the majority are found in women for reasons that are unknown. Tho-
racic radiation exposure and exposure to occupational or environmental toxins,
such as asbestos or radon, are also associated with increased risk of developing
lung cancer.
19_Toy-IM_Case18_p193-202.indd 196 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,224,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 197
Data from the National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated a reduction in lung
cancer mortality in select high-risk patients who undergo an annual low-dose CT
scan of the chest; these high-risk patients include adults 55 to 80 years old with
a 30 pack-year smoking history who are current smokers, or quit within the last
15 years, and do not have other life-limiting diseases.
Clinical Presentation
Only 5% to 15% of patients with lung cancer are asymptomatic when diagnosed. In
these cases, a lung nodule usually is found incidentally on chest x-ray or CT.
Endobronchial tumors may present with cough or with hemoptysis. Chest
pain is also a possible symptom of lung cancer and suggests pleural involvement or
neoplastic invasion of the chest wall. Constitutional symptoms like weight loss,
malaise, and fatigue usually develop later in the disease course. Malignant pleural
effusion is common and may lead to presenting symptoms of shortness of breath
and chest pain. Two well-known syndromes are associated with lung cancer:
Horner syndrome and SVC syndrome. Horner syndrome is caused by the inva-
sion of the cervicothoracic sympathetic nerves and occurs with apical tumors
(Pancoast tumor). Phrenic nerve invasion may cause diaphragmatic paralysis. SVC
obstruction is produced by direct extension of the tumor or by compression from
the neighboring lymph nodes. SVC syndrome has a dramatic clinical presentation
and is a medical emergency requiring urgent care. The clinical presentation is facial
swelling, hoarseness of voice, arm swelling, stridor, and nasal stuffiness.
Once a patient presents with symptoms or radiographic findings suggestive of
lung cancer, the next steps are as follows:
1. Tissue diagnosis to establish malignant diagnosis and histologic type
2. Staging to determine resectability or curative potential
3. Cancer treatment: surgery, radiotherapy, traditional chemotherapy, or targeted
therapies
Classification. Histologically, primary lung cancer can be divided into two major
categories with important therapeutic implications: small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC accounts for approximately 86%
of all primary lung cancers compared to only 14% for SCLC. NSCLC is further
classified into three or more major histologic types, including squamous cell carci-
noma (SCC), adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and others.
SCC usually does not metastasize early. It is usually a central/hilar lesion with
local extension that may present with symptoms caused by bronchial obstruction,
such as atelectasis and pneumonia. SCC is the most likely lung cancer to cavitate
and may be seen on x-ray as a central cavitary lesion. It may also produce parathy-
roid hormone–related protein, which causes hypercalcemia.
Adenocarcinoma and large-cell cancer are peripheral lesions. Adenocarcinoma
metastasizes early, especially to the central nervous system (CNS), bones, and adre-
nal glands. Adenocarcinoma has the lowest association with smoking and a stronger
association with pulmonary scars/fibrosis. Large-cell cancer is usually a peripheral
lesion and tends to metastasize to the CNS and mediastinum. It can cause SVC

syndrome or hoarseness as a consequence of laryngeal nerve paralysis. Individually,
the other NSCLC subtypes represent only a fraction of total lung cancer cases and
have a varied presentation.
Small-cell carcinoma is made up of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine cells.
It is extremely aggressive but in general responds better to chemotherapy than
NSCLC. The primary lesion is typically central. Eighty percent of patients have
metastasis at the time of diagnosis, so its treatment generally differs from that
of other lung cancers. Contrary to other lung cancers, cavitation never occurs in
small-cell cancer. SCLC can cause paraneoplastic syndromes, including syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), ectopic adrenocortico-
tropic hormone (ACTH; corticotropin) production, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
Table 18–1 lists typical characteristics of various cell types.
SCLC is initially very responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but
unfortunately, most SCLC relapses. Additionally, SCLC has almost always spread
at time of diagnosis, so surgical treatment with curative intent is not possible. In
contrast, NSCLC is much less responsive to chemotherapy or to radiation, but
tumors that are localized at time of diagnosis may be treated with curative surgery
or with radiation therapy. The majority of NSCLC subtypes have similar treatment
and prognoses at similar stages.
Treatment
Treatment of lung cancer consists of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and/or radi-
ation therapy in different combinations, depending on the tissue type and extent of
the disease, and may be performed with either curative or palliative intent. Targeted
therapies against mutations prevalent in adenocarcinoma subtypes are increasingly
being used with variable success.
Once the diagnosis of NSCLC is made, the next step is to stage the disease to
decide whether the cancer is resectable and thus potentially curable. Patients may
be candidates for resection if the cancer is localized to one hemithorax, which may
19_Toy-IM_Case18_p193-202.indd 198 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,226,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 199
include ipsilateral, but not contralateral, hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and
there are no major anatomic barriers to successful resection.
SCLC is nearly always metastatic at time of diagnosis and, therefore, not eligible
for surgical resection. It is staged as either limited, disease confined to one hemi-
thorax that can be treated within a radiotherapy port, or extensive, disease with
contralateral lung involvement or distant metastases that is treated with systemic
therapies. Patients with untreated, advanced SCLC have a poor prognosis, with
survival generally measured in weeks. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients with
limited-stage disease can be cured with radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however,
the prognosis for relapsed patients is poor.
Because most lung cancer occurs in older patients who have been smokers,
patients with lung cancer frequently have underlying cardiopulmonary disease
and require preoperative evaluation, including pulmonary function testing, to
predict whether they have sufficient pulmonary reserve to tolerate a lobectomy
(removal of one lung lobe) or pneumonectomy (removal of one lung). Perfor-
mance status, or general well-being of the patient, is also taken into consideration
when deciding if a patient is even a candidate for therapy or what type of therapy
is appropriate.
Solitary Pulmonary Nodule. The solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as a
nodule surrounded by normal parenchyma. Most incidentally discovered nod-
ules are benign, but differentiation between benign etiologies and early-stage
malignancy can be challenging. Proper management of a solitary nodule in an
individual patient depends on a variety of elements: age, risk factors, presence of
calcifications, and size of the nodule. Of these factors, size is highly predictive.
Larger lesions are more likely to be malignant than smaller lesions. In one study,
the likelihood of malignancy was 0.2% for nodules smaller than 3 mm, 0.9% for
nodules 4 to 7 mm, 18% for nodules 8 to 20 mm, and 50% for nodules larger
than 20 mm. Put another way, greater than 99% of nodules measuring less than
8 mm are benign.
The presence and type of calcification on a solitary pulmonary nodule can be
helpful. “Popcorn” and “bull’s-eye” calcifications suggest a benign process, whereas
absence of calcification increases the likelihood of malignancy.
Professional organizations such as the Fleischner Society offer a widely accepted
algorithm for follow-up imaging of solitary pulmonary nodules. Generally speak-
ing, for lesions 8 mm or less, serial CT imaging is an acceptable strategy to monitor
for growth. Radiographic stability for 2 years or longer is strong evidence of benign
etiology. For lesions 1 cm or greater, additional studies, such as positron emission
tomography scan, transthoracic needle biopsy, or bronchoscopic evaluation, may be
indicated.

Case Files Internal Medicine,228,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 201
ANSWERS
18.1 C. The patient has features of SVC syndrome, caused by compression of the
SVC, almost always by a thoracic malignancy. Urgent diagnosis and treatment
are mandatory because of impaired cerebral venous drainage and resultant
increased intracranial pressure or possibly fatal intracranial venous throm-
bosis. Angioedema (answer A), hypothyroidism (answer B), and trichinosis
(answer D) all may cause facial swelling, but not the redness (plethora) or
swelling of the arm.
18.2 B. This patient has chronic hoarseness and unilateral wheezing. This sug-
gests an intrathoracic mass causing bronchial obstruction and impairment of
the recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing vocal cord paralysis. Thus, an imaging
study of the chest is essential. If the chest x-ray is negative, the voice hoarse-
ness still needs to be pursued, such as by laryngoscopy, to assess for pathology
of the vocal cords or larynx. Answer A (antibiotics for bronchitis) may be
appropriate in the clinical setting of 1-2 weeks of cough and voice hoarse-
ness; however, once voice hoarseness has lasted longer 3 weeks, investigation
for cancer must be undertaken. Similarly, answer C (Saltwater gargling) and
answer D (Albuterol inhaler) are symptomatic measures, and more aggressive
diagnostic interventions are required.
18.3 B. The most common form of lung cancer found in nonsmokers, young
patients, and women is adenocarcinoma. Of note, 85% of patients with lung
cancer of all histologic types have a smoking history.
18.4 C. Biopsy of the hilar mass is important because tissue diagnosis is essen-
tial for proper treatment of any malignancy; for this reason, biopsy should
generally be the first step. Once a specific tissue diagnosis is obtained, the
cancer is staged (answer A) for prognosis and to guide therapy. Therapeutic
options may be surgical resection, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Questions
for this patient include the tissue type, location of spread, and whether the
pleural effusion is caused by malignancy. Answer B (Pulmonary function
tests) are not indicated until a diagnosis is determined to see what treatment
is needed. Answer D (Palliative radiation) is not indicated until cancer is
diagnosed.

until 1 week ago, when he developed mild nasal congestion and generalized
achiness. Last night he became feverish and fatigued, and he developed a cough
associated with nonbloody sputum production and right-sided chest pain.
The patient also expressed mild exertional dyspnea when walking his dog this
morning. His medical history is remarkable only for mild, intermittent asthma,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. His medications are lisinopril and atorvastatin.
The patient admits to smoking a pack per day for the last 20 years. He states he
drinks a glass of wine two or three times a week and denies drug use. In your office,
his vital signs are normal except for a temperature of 39 °C (102.2 °F). His oxygen
saturation is 100% on room air. Physical examination shows a mostly comfortable
man (except when he coughs) with bronchial breath sounds and end-inspiratory
crackles in the right lower lung field. The remaining examination is unremarkable.
A chest x-ray demonstrates a homogeneous opacity with bronchogram on the
right lower pulmonary field.

ANSWERS TO CASE 19:
Community-Acquired Pneumonia
Summary: A 44-year-old man presents with
Sudden onset of shaking chills, fever, dyspnea on exertion, and productive cough with

pleuritic chest pain
A 102.2 °F fever without tachypnea or hypoxia

Bronchial breath sounds and end-inspiratory crackles in the right lower lung field

Consolidation on the right pulmonary base on chest x-ray

Most likely diagnosis: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Most likely etiology: The etiologies of CAP within this patient’s demographic
include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci,
Moraxella catarrhalis, viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae,
Chlamydia psittaci, and Legionella species; however, the most common isolate is
Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Next step: Chest x-ray. If the images confirm the suspicion of pneumonia, then
start antibiotic therapy, pain relievers, antipyretics, and cough suppressants for
relief of symptoms. Close outpatient follow-up (in 1-2 weeks) is also important.
Risk factors: Common CAP risk factors include alcohol abuse, smoking, Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunosuppression, and recent influenza
infection.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the causative organisms in CAP and the appropriate therapeutic
regimens. (EPA 3, 4)
2. Differentiate the clinical criteria indicating inpatient versus outpatient therapy.
(EPA 4, 7, 10)
3. Analyze the role of radiologic and laboratory evaluation in the diagnosis of
pneumonia. (EPA 3)
4. Compare and contrast the difference between chemical pneumonitis and
infectious aspiration pneumonia. (EPA 1, 2)
Considerations
This previously healthy 44-year-old man displayed clinical and radiographic evi-
dence of a focal lung consolidation, which is consistent with a bacterial process,
such as a S. pneumoniae infection. The specific causative organism is usually not
definitively established, so empiric antimicrobial therapy will need to be initiated
and the patient response monitored. It will also be necessary to risk stratify the

patient to determine whether he can safely be treated as an outpatient or requires
hospitalization.
APPROACH TO:
Community-Acquired Pneumonia
DEFINITIONS
COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP): An infection of the alveoli,
distal airways, and interstitium of the lungs that is acquired outside the hospital
setting, affecting individuals of all ages.
HEALTH CARE–ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (HCAP): Pneumonia develop-
ing 48 hours after admission that was not present prior to admission. The previous
concept of HCAP has since fallen out of favor due to its inability to be sensitive or
specific in identifying patients who might be at risk. HCAP was previously defined
as pneumonia occurring in a nonhospitalized patient with extensive health care con-
tact, including one of the following: intravenous therapy, wound care, intravenous
chemotherapy within the prior 30 days, those who live in a nursing home or other
long-term care facility, hospitalization in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days
within the prior 90 days, or attendance at a hospital or hemodialysis clinic within the
prior 30 days. Recently, terminology has changed so that nursing home patients who
develop pneumonia is called CAP.
PNEUMONIA: Inflammation of the lung parenchyma, which may be caused
by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or rarely protozoa or noninfectious diseases. In the
day-to-day medical language, it refers to an infection affecting the lung.
VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA: Pneumonia that develops
48 hours after intubation.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Community-acquired pneumonia, as opposed to HCAP, in adults is most commonly
caused by S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, C. pneumoniae, or respira-
tory viruses, such as influenza and adenovirus. Despite a careful history and physi-
cal, routine laboratory tests, and radiographic investigation, it remains difficult to
determine a specific pathogen in most cases. Epidemiologic risk factors and certain
exposures may provide additional clues: C. psittaci is associated with bird expo-
sure, coccidioidomycosis is associated with travel to the American southwest, and
histoplasmosis is endemic to the Mississippi Valley and common in spelunkers. In
a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or immunosuppres-
sion, Pneumocystis jiroveci should instantly be added to the differential diagnosis.
Tuberculosis should always be considered a possibility in patients with a history
suggestive of exposure or predisposition (ie, homelessness or exposure to shelters,
20_Toy-IM_Case19_p203-212.indd 205 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,233,"206 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
previous incarceration, emigration from countries of high endemicity, unvaccinated
or immunocompromised state) to this disease.
Pathogens in HCAP include methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudo-
monas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp, and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed accordingly.
Clinical Presentation
Pneumonia represents inflammation, commonly infectious of the lung parenchyma.
Patients may present with any combination of cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain,
sputum production, shortness of breath, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. Certain
clinical presentations are associated with particular infectious agents. For example,
characteristics of “typical” pneumonia include sudden onset of fever, cough with
productive sputum, pleuritic chest pain, and occasionally rust-colored sputum. This
describes the classic presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia.
The “atypical” pneumonia is recognized by a more insidious onset, a dry cough,
and prominent extrapulmonary symptoms such as headache, myalgias, and sore
throat. In addition, a chest radiograph usually appears much worse than the clini-
cal or auscultatory findings. M. pneumoniae remains the most commonly identified
pathogen attributed to “atypical” pneumonia. Although these characterizations are
of some diagnostic value, there are no features that can distinguish between typi-
cal and atypical pneumonia based on the clinical history and physical examination
alone. Therefore, pneumonias are typically classified according to the immune sta-
tus of the host, the radiographic findings, and the setting in which the infection was
acquired in an attempt to identify the most likely causative organisms and to guide
initial empiric therapy.
Risk Stratification. Once the clinical diagnosis of infectious pneumonia has been
made, the next step is to risk stratify the patients to determine which patients can be
treated safely as outpatients with oral antibiotics and which require hospitalization.
Two major risk stratification tools are currently employeds: the Pneumonia Severity
Index (PSI) and the CURB-65. The PSI stratifies patients into five groups based
on a 30-day all-cause mortality in those with radiographically proven pneumonia.
This two-step processes involves first using patient demographic factors:— age
> 50, medical history comorbidities, and physical examination findings—to deter-
mine low-risk patients (risk class I: outpatient treatment). Patients possessing these
factors progress to step 2, which utilizes objective laboratory findings to further
classify patients in classes II to IV based on the number of points assigned per risk
factor. Scoring is determined by taking the age (subtract 10 in women) and adding
a point for each risk factor. The other stages are as follows: class II (scores < 70),
class III (score 71-90), class IV (scores 91-130), and class V (scores > 130).
Patients in classes I and II have a predicted mortality of less than 0.6% and are suit-
able for outpatient treatment, while patients in class V have a 30-day mortality risk
of 27%. Calculating PSI is laborious.
The CURB-65 serves as a simplified prognostic score using five variables:
Confusion (1 point)
Urea greater than 20 mg/dL (1 point)
20_Toy-IM_Case19_p203-212.indd 206 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,234,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 207
Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/min (1 point)
Blood pressure, systolic less than 90 mm Hg (1 point)
Age greater than 65 (1 point)
Patients with a score of 0 to 1 have a 30-day mortality below 3%, and they
can usually be safely treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics. However, further
analysis should be performed to ensure the patient’s ability to take oral medications
and the availability of outpatient support. Scores of 2 or greater require hospital-
ization, and those of 3 or greater should be assessed for intensive care unit (ICU)
admission. Patients with a score of 3 or greater have a 30-day mortality of 15% to
40%. Compared to PSI, CURB-65 assigns no points to comorbid illnesses; another
limitation of CURB-65 is that it assumes that the confusion is related to the acute
pneumonia.
Although outpatients usually are diagnosed and empiric therapy is started
based on clinical findings, further diagnostic evaluation is necessary in hospitalized
patients. Chest radiography is required to diagnose CAP, to define the extent of
the pneumonia, and to look for complications, such as parapneumonic effusion or
lung abscess. Unless the patient cannot mount an immune response, as in severe
neutropenia, significant dehydration, or early in the disease process, every patient
with pneumonia will have a visible pulmonary consolidation.
Imaging. The pattern of infiltration can yield diagnostic clues. Infection with
S. pneumoniae classically presents with a dense lobar consolidation, often with an
associated parapneumonic effusion. Diffuse interstitial opacities are common in
Pneumocystis pneumonia and viral processes. Conversely, pleural effusions are
almost never seen in Pneumocystis pneumonia. Bilateral apical alveolar opacities
(with or without cavitation) suggest tuberculosis. Appearance of cavitation sug-
gests a necrotizing infection such as S. aureus, tuberculosis, or gram-negative
organisms like P. aeruginosa or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Serial chest radiography of
inpatients usually is unnecessary because many weeks are required for the infil-
trate to resolve; serial chest radiography typically is performed if the patient does
not show clinical improvement, has a pleural effusion, or has a necrotizing infec-
tion. Infiltrates that are not resolving or that are relapsing on the same lung field
represent a red flag for obstruction of the bronchus corresponding with that area;
malignancy is usually the culprit.
Laboratory Results. Microbiologic studies, such as blood cultures and sputum
Gram stain and culture, should be obtained to try to establish the etiology. Sputum
samples are frequently contaminated by oral flora, limiting their value, though their
diagnostic yield increases when sputum is purulent (> 25 polymorphonuclear cells
and < 10 epithelial cells per low-power field). Additionally, blood cultures can fur-
ther classify the etiology of pneumonia, especially since 30% to 40% of pneumococ-
cal pneumonia patients are bacteremic on admission. Further serologic studies can
diagnose patients who are infected with organisms not easily cultured, for example,
Legionella, Mycoplasma, or C. pneumoniae.
Bronchoscopy. Finally, fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is
often performed in seriously ill patients, the immunocompromised, and patients
who are not responding to therapy. This procedure obtains specimens from the
20_Toy-IM_Case19_p203-212.indd 207 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,235,"208 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
lower respiratory tract for routine Gram stain and culture, as well as direct fluores-
cent antibody testing for organisms such as Legionella or P. jiroveci.
Treatment
Initially, empiric treatment is based on the most common organisms given the clini-
cal scenario. Macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin), doxycycline, or antipneumococ-
cal fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) are good choices for outpatient
treatment of CAP caused by S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, and other common
bacterial organisms. Keep in mind that increasing community resistance patterns
alter available antibiotic coverage. In regard to outpatient therapy duration, antibi-
otics should be administered for a minimum of 5 days. Hospitalized patients with
CAP usually require intravenous third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide
(or antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone). For immunocompetent patients with
hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonias, initial antibiotic coverage is
broader, with more serious antibiotic coverage. Some common antimicrobials cho-
sen include piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or merope-
nem. In addition, for patients with risk factors for MRSA infection (ie, prior
intravenous antibiotic use, intravenous drug usage, recent ventilatory support),
empiric coverage for MRSA such as vancomycin or linezolid should be added. Vac-
cination for influenza and pneumococcus should be considered for all who meet
the criteria. Smoking cessation is also an integral part of postrecovery care.
Other Pulmonary Syndromes
Three other commonly confused pulmonary syndromes deserve mention at this
point: aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and mechanical obstruction.
Aspiration Pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia refers to the inflammation pro-
moted by infectious agents that results from abnormal entry of fluids or secre-
tions into the lower airways when defensive mechanisms of the upper airway fail.
It should be noted that many healthy adults frequently aspirate small volumes of
oropharyngeal secretions while sleeping (this is the primary way that bacteria gain
entry to the lungs), but the material is cleared by coughing, ciliary transport, or
normal immune defenses so that no clinical infection results. The affected lobe of
the lung depends on the patient’s position: In recumbent patients, the posterior
segments of the upper lobes and superior segments of the lower lobes are most
common.
Chemical Pneumonitis. Chemical pneumonitis refers to the aspiration of toxic
substances (the most common being gastric acid) into the lower airway without
the development of bacterial infection. The inflammation is proportional to the
volume of the aspirate and the acidity of the content. The clinical presentation can
go from minor dyspnea and low-grade fever to severe respiratory distress and a pul-
monary infiltrate that is apparent within 4 to 6 hours and typically resolves within
48 hours. Aspiration of gastric contents is most likely to occur in patients with a
depressed level of consciousness, such as with anesthesia, drug overdose, intoxi-
cation, or a postictal state. This process has also been described among victims
of smoke inhalation. Treatment for chemical pneumonitis is usually supportive
and involves positive pressure breathing, intravenous fluids, and tracheal suction.
20_Toy-IM_Case19_p203-212.indd 208 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,236,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 209
Infectious pneumonia should be considered in those who fail to show clinical
improvement after 48 hours of presumed chemical pneumonitis; those with sig-
nificant comorbidities can be started on antibiotics initially. In contrast to chemical
pneumonitis, where aspiration of vomitus may be witnessed, the aspiration of oral
secretions typically is silent and should be suspected when any institutionalized
patient with dysphagia presents with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infil-
trate in a dependent segment of the lung.
Antibiotic therapy for presumed bacterial aspiration (infectious) pneumonia is
similar to that of other pneumonias; antibiotics should cover typical respiratory
pathogens such as oral anaerobes, gram-negative organisms, S. pneumoniae, and
H. influenzae. When anaerobes are likely, first-line therapy is ampicillin-sulbactam,
amoxicillin-clavulanate, or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or
penicillin G. Clindamycin use has declined secondary to increased resistance; how-
ever, it can still be used in those with penicillin allergies.
Airway Obstruction. Airway obstruction refers to the inhalation of nontoxic
fluid or matter causing obstruction or closure of distal airways. The most common
aspirated items include water, saline, barium, and food. The fluids/matter can result
in a reversible hypoxemia. Treatment involves removal of the obstruction with
supportive care.

A. Admit to the floor and start intravenous cefepime and linezolid.
B. Admit to the floor and start intravenous azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
C. Admit to the ICU and start intravenous vancomycin and linezolid.
D. Discharge home with a prescription of oral amoxicillin and cefpodoxime.
E. Discharge home with oral azithromycin and oral cefpodoxime.
19.3 A 56-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, chronic kidney
disease stage III, gout, and alcohol dependence is brought in by emergency
medical services after being found down on the ground. He smells strongly of
ethanol and has a prior history of delirium tremens based on previous medi-
cal records. He is admitted to the ICU with concern for alcohol withdrawal.
His vitals on admission are: temperature 37 °C, BP 110/74 mm Hg, heart rate
77 bpm, RR 12 breaths/min, and SpO of 94% on room air. Due to concern
2
for inability to protect his airway, he is intubated in the emergency room. The

that day, he goes into withdrawal with altered mental status, and aspirates
while eating. What is the next best step in management?
A. Obtain chest x-rays and continue to monitor for symptoms.
B. Obtain chest x-rays and start azithromycin therapy.
C. Obtain chest x-rays and start vancomycin and cefepime.
D. Obtain chest x-rays, perform bronchoscopy, and initiate steroid treatment.
ANSWERS
19.1 D. Legionella typically presents with diffuse myalgias, abdominal pain, diar-
rhea, and severe pneumonia. Tobacco dependence increases susceptibility to
Legionella as well. Typically, it is associated with hyponatremia on laboratory
tests. C. pneumoniae (answer B) typically presents in older patients with more
indolent symptoms and associated pharyngitis, hoarseness, and/or sinus
involvement. M. pneumonia (answer E) tends to appear in young adults, with
significantly fewer toxic symptoms; this is why it is also known as walking
pneumonia. Bullous myringitis (blisters seen on the tympanic membrane)
is frequently associated. Coccidioidomycosis (answer C) is endemic in the
southwestern United States and causes a subclinical infection, often after
dust exposure. Aspergillus (answer A) is more common in immunocompro-
mised individuals and can present with hemoptysis and lung infarction.
20_Toy-IM_Case19_p203-212.indd 210 03/09/20 9:20 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,238,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 211
19.2 B. This nursing home resident would be considered to have CAP, with a
similar infectious rate as individuals not residing in nursing homes. Using
CURB-65, the patient would have three points (confusion for her worsening
mental status, respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, and her age). These crite-
ria indicate the need for hospitalization with possible consideration for ICU
admission; thus, discharging this patient home (answers D and E) would be
inappropriate. The use of ceftriaxone (or other third-generation cephalospo-
rins) and azithromycin would be appropriate therapy. Vancomycin and line-
zolid (answer C) cover gram-positive organisms only.
19.3 A. The patient did aspirate; however, this does not automatically mean aspi-
ration pneumonia will develop. The first steps are to obtain imaging and
monitor closely. If symptoms (fevers or purulent sputum production) develop
or the patient fails to improve after 48 hours, then ampicillin-sulbactam,
amoxicillin-clavulanate, or metronidazole plus amoxicillin can be started to
cover anaerobic mouth bacteria. Azithromycin (answer B) is indicated for
CAP but is not the appropriate therapy for aspiration pneumonia. Vancomy-
cin and cefepime (answer C) would not need to be started unless necrotizing
pneumonia is suspected. Last, bronchoscopy (answer D) is typically not
required for aspiration pneumonitis diagnosis, and steroids are not used.
CLINICAL PEARLS
It is difficult to reliably distinguish clinically between typical and atypi-
»
cal causes of pneumonia. Therefore, diagnosis and empiric treatment of
pneumonia are based on the setting in which it was acquired (CAP or
HCAP) and the immune status of the host.
Clinical criteria, such as patient’s age, vital signs, mental status, renal func-
»
tion, and additional comorbidities can be used to risk stratify patients
with pneumonia to decide who can be treated as an outpatient and who
requires hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics.
Although initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, the etiologic agent fre-
»
quently can be identified based on chest radiography, blood cultures,
or sputum Gram stain and culture. Once determined, antibiotics can be
deescalated for more specific coverage.
Chemical pneumonitis is a noninfectious, chemically induced inflam-
»
mation caused by inhalation of acidic gastric contents in patients with a
decreased level of consciousness, such as seizure or overdose; however,
if patients fail to improve within 48 hours, antibiotic interventions can be
started. It can also be seen in victims of smoke inhalation.
Aspiration (infectious) pneumonia is a pulmonary infection caused by
»
aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal secretions and is seen in patients
with impaired swallowing, such as stroke victims. The treatment is
antibiotics.

A 37-year-old executive returns to your clinic for follow-up of recurrent
upper abdominal pain. He had been experiencing a “burning” epigastric pain
intermittently for more than 2 years but did not seek medical attention until
recently, when the pain increased in frequency and severity over the past
2 months. The pain now occurs three to four times per week, is more noticeable
“on an empty stomach,” and often awakens him at night. The pain is usually
relieved immediately after eating or using over-the-counter antacids, but it recurs
within 2 to 3 hours. He admits to experiencing increased stress at work, drinking
more caffeine, and frequently eating take-out foods because of his busy schedule.
His medical history and review of systems are otherwise unremarkable. He takes
no medications besides the occasional use of antacids. His physical examination is
normal, including a stool guaiac test, which was negative for occult blood. Results
of the laboratory tests performed at his initial visit show no anemia, but his serum
Helicobacter pylori antibody test is positive.

ANSWERS TO CASE 20:
Peptic Ulcer Disease
Summary: A 37-year-old man presents with
“Burning” abdominal pain located in the epigastrium that is relieved with meals but

recurs 2 to 3 hours later
No evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding

Serologies positive for H. pylori infection

Most likely diagnosis: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) since the patient has recurrent,
burning epigastric pain and positive serologies for H. pylori.
Risk factors: Infection with H. pylori or chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs).
Next step: Triple therapy (PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) for H. pylori.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Differentiate common causes of abdominal pain by historical clues. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Recognize clinical features of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers and
“alarm symptoms” that increase concern for gastric cancer. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Understand the association between H. pylori infection and the use of
NSAIDs in the development of PUD. (EPA 2, 12)
4. Understand and interpret the laboratory tests used for diagnosing H. pylori
infection. (EPA 3)
Considerations
This is a 37-year-old man whose symptoms are suggestive of a duodenal ulcer.
He does not demonstrate alarm symptoms, such as weight loss, bleeding, or
anemia. Moreover, his young age and chronicity of complaints make gastric
malignancy a less likely diagnosis. H. pylori is the most common cause of PUD,
requiring eradication to promote ulcer healing and to prevent development of
gastric cancers (eg, gastric adenocarcinoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
[MALT] lymphoma).

APPROACH TO:
Peptic Ulcer Disease
DEFINITIONS
DYSPEPSIA: Pain or discomfort located in the upper abdomen (“epigastrium”),
which may be associated with fullness, early satiety, bloating, or nausea. Dyspepsia
can be intermittent or continuous and may be related to meals.
FUNCTIONAL (NONULCER) DYSPEPSIA: Symptoms as described for dys-
pepsia, persisting for at least 12 weeks but without evidence of ulcer on endoscopy.
HELICOBACTER PYLORI: A gram-negative microaerophilic bacillus that resides
within the gastric mucosa and causes chronic inflammation. It is urease positive,
capable of hydrolyzing urea into ammonia carbonate, thus alkalinizing the local pH
and allowing it to survive in an acidic environment. H. pylori is associated with 30%
to 60% of gastric ulcers and with 50% to 70% of duodenal ulcers.
PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE (PUD): Presence of gastric or duodenal mucosal ulcer-
ation, visualized by endoscopy or by upper gastrointestinal barium study.
TRIPLE THERAPY: Treatment for PUD caused by H. pylori; consists of amoxicil-
lin, clarithromycin, and a PPI (replace amoxicillin with metronidazole if penicillin
allergy is present).
QUADRUPLE THERAPY: Alternative treatment for PUD caused by H. pylori,
in setting of clarithromycin resistance; consists of metronidazole, a tetracycline, a
bismuth compound, and a PPI.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Upper abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints encountered in pri-
mary care. Many patients have benign functional disorders (ie, no specific pathol-
ogy can be identified after diagnostic testing), but others have potentially more
serious conditions, such as PUD or gastric cancer. Historical clues, knowledge of
the epidemiology of diseases, and some simple laboratory assessments can help to
separate benign from serious causes of pain. However, endoscopy is often necessary
to confirm the diagnosis.
The two major risk factors for developing PUD are chronic infection with H. pylori
and the use of NSAIDs. Certain virulence factors of H. pylori are important for produc-
ing ulcer formation and include urease, adhesins, and cytotoxins. Urease is an enzyme
that hydrolyzes urea into ammonium carbonate, thus producing an alkaline environ-
ment, and is an essential virulent factor for H. pylori to survive in the stomach. Adhesins
(BabA, OipA) facilitate the attachment of H. pylori to the gastric epithelium. Almost all
H. pylori contain the vacA gene, which encodes for a vacuolating cytotoxin that causes
gastrointestinal inflammation. However, not all H. pylori express the vacA protein.
Therefore, the role of this specific gene in the pathogenesis of PUD remains unclear.
21_Toy-IM_Case20_p213-220.indd 215 03/09/20 9:19 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,243,"216 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Use of NSAIDs is another major risk factor for the development of PUD, pri-
marily mediating ulcer formation by inhibiting the constitutively expressed cyclo-
oxygenase 1 (COX-1)–derived prostaglandins. Inhibition of these prostaglandins is
associated with impaired gastric defenses within the host, such as decreased vaso-
dilation of mucosal blood vessels and low secretion of gastric mucus and bicarbonate.
The risk of ulcer formation due to NSAIDs is dose dependent and may even occur
within days of NSAID use.
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare, yet highly tested, cause of ulcer-
ation that involves a gastrin-producing tumor (“gastrinoma”; usually located in the
pancreas), resulting in acid hypersecretion. This condition should be suspected if
patients have ulcers refractory to standard medical therapy, ulcers in unusual loca-
tions (eg, jejunum), or ulcers without a history of NSAID use or H. pylori infec-
tion. Endoscopy shows multiple gastric ulcers and prominent rugae of the gastric
mucosa. About 25% of gastrinomas occur in patients with multiple endocrine
neoplasia I (MEN I) syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder charac-
terized by parathyroid, pancreatic, and pituitary neoplasms. To diagnose ZES, the
first step is to measure a fasting gastrin level, followed by a secretin stimulation
test, which paradoxically elevates gastrin levels (> 1000 pg/mL). Once ZES is sus-
pected, an imaging study (eg, abdominal computed tomography [CT]) is used to
localize the tumor.
Clinical Presentation
Dyspepsia refers to upper abdominal pain or discomfort, which may be produced
by several gastrointestinal disorders, including PUD. Gastroesophageal reflux dis-
ease (GERD) typically produces “heartburn,” a burning epigastric or chest pain,
associated with regurgitation of gastric content, usually occurring after meals and
worsening with recumbency. Patients with GERD may also complain of a chronic
dry cough, secondary to aspiration of gastric contents and stimulation of cough
receptors in the lower respiratory tract. Biliary colic is characterized by an acute
onset of right upper quadrant pain, lasting 30 to 60 minutes, and precipitated by
fatty meals. Biliary colic is more common in fertile, middle-aged women. Irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) is a diagnosis of exclusion, characterized by chronic dys-
motility symptoms (bloating, cramping) and relieved with defecation. Patients
report a mixture of constipation and diarrhea without weight loss or GI bleeding.
PUD manifests when gastric acid erodes the mucosal and muscularis layers of
the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of an ulcer. These ulcers are
most commonly located in the stomach (gastric ulcer) or duodenum (duodenal
ulcer). Patients typically present with a gnawing/burning pain, located in the epigas-
trium without radiation to the back and relieved by antacids (ie, calcium carbonate,
aluminum-magnesium hydroxide). Other associated symptoms may vary, depend-
ing on the location of the ulcer. Gastric ulcers typically present with postprandial
abdominal pain, leading to an aversion of food, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.
Patients with duodenal ulcers may experience weight gain because the pain asso-
ciated with these ulcers is initially relieved during meals, when ingestion of food
stimulates bicarbonate secretion into the duodenum. The pain, however, worsens
2 to 5 hours later, when acidic gastric contents are emptied from the stomach and
21_Toy-IM_Case20_p213-220.indd 216 03/09/20 9:19 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,244,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 217
enter the duodenum, directly irritating the ulcer. Pain associated with duodenal
ulcers may also worsen at night due to circadian stimulation of acid secretion.
Young patients without alarm features may undergo noninvasive testing, such as
serology for H. pylori antibody, urea breath test, or fecal H. pylori antigen test. The
urea breath test and serology for the H. pylori antibody are the most commonly used
noninvasive tests to detect active infection. However, serologic testing for H. pylori
is only useful if the patient has never been previously treated for H. pylori since
antibodies will be positive for life, even after successful treatment.
Treatment
Chronic infection with H. pylori is the most common cause for both gastric
and duodenal ulcers. Therefore, the standard of care is to test the patient
for infection and treat with triple or quadruple therapy if present. Although
triple therapy has traditionally been the gold standard for H. pylori eradica-
tion, clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori have been identified, resulting in
decreased efficacy of triple therapy. Quadruple therapy is preferred if the patient
has ever had exposure to macrolides for any reason, if local clarithromycin resistance
rates are > 15%, or if eradication rates with triple therapy are < 85%. A follow-up
visit within 4 to 8 weeks is recommended to ensure H. pylori eradication. Fecal
H. pylori antigen testing may be used to confirm eradication following treatment. If
the patient is older (> 45 years) or presents with alarm symptoms, an esophagogas-
troduodenoscopy (EGD) with or without biopsy, depending on gastric (high risk)
versus duodenal (low risk) ulcer, should be performed to rule out malignancy.
Treatment for PUD caused by NSAIDs consists of discontinuing the offending
agent and initiating a PPI to reduce acid secretion and promote ulcer healing.
Complications
Approximately 70% of peptic ulcers are asymptomatic and may go unnoticed until
complications develop. The most common severe complication of PUD is hemor-
rhage. Patients may complain of hematemesis (“coffee ground emesis”) or melena.
Chronic ulcers may result in gastric outlet obstruction symptoms due to forma-
tion of strictures. Similarly, ulcers located near the pyloric channel may also cause
obstructive symptoms due to mass effect. Transmural ulcers may cause perforation
within the gastrointestinal tract. Ulcers that perforate the lesser curvature of the
stomach or posterior wall of the duodenum may cause hemorrhage due to involve-
ment of the left gastric artery and gastroduodenal artery, respectively. Perforation
of the anterior wall of the duodenum may lead to peritonitis (eg, rebound tender-
ness, involuntary guarding) and referred pain to the shoulder due to phrenic nerve
irritation caused by free air accumulation below the diaphragm. Perforation near
the pancreas may result in pancreatitis. Both obstructive and peritoneal symptoms
are indications for surgery.
Moreover, unlike duodenal ulcers, which have a low propensity for malignant
transformation, approximately 5% to 10% of gastric ulcers are malignant (eg,
gastric adenocarcinoma). Gastric ulcers should be evaluated endoscopically
with an EGD and biopsied to exclude gastric cancer, which may also present as
nausea/vomiting, dysphagia, and early satiety. Chronic H. pylori infection may also
result in the development of a gastric MALT tumor.

Case Files Internal Medicine,245,"218 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
In general, patients older than 45 years who present with new-onset dyspepsia
should undergo endoscopy since the risk of malignancy increases with age. Fur-
thermore, patients with alarm symptoms (eg, weight loss, recurrent vomiting, dys-
phagia, evidence of GI bleeding, or iron-deficiency anemia) or who fail to respond
to empiric therapy should also be referred for prompt endoscopic evaluation.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
20.1 A previously healthy 42-year-old overweight woman presents to the emer-
gency department complaining of sudden, right upper abdominal pain that
“comes and goes,” lasting approximately 45 minutes after eating at a fast-food
restaurant. The patient has vomited twice since the pain started, and any
attempt to eat worsens the pain. She is sexually active with one male partner,
uses condoms regularly, and denies drug use. Which of the following is the
most likely cause?
A. Gastric ulcer
B. Cholelithiasis
C. Duodenal ulcer
D. Acute hepatitis
20.2 A 34-year-old man is being seen in the office for follow-up for epigastric pain
and suspected PUD. Serum antibodies are positive for H. pylori. Which of
the following is the most accurate statement regarding this infection?
A. It is more common in North America than in the developing world.
B. It is associated with the development of colon cancer.
C. Eradication of H. pylori eliminates most cases of nonulcer dyspepsia.
D. It is believed to be sexually transmitted.
E. It is a cause of both duodenal and gastric ulcers.
20.3 A 45-year-old man was brought to the emergency department after vomit-
ing bright red blood. He has a blood pressure of 88/46 mm Hg and heart
rate of 120 bpm. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and preparation for a transfusion
B. Administration of a PPI
C. Guaiac test of the stool
D. Treatment for H. pylori

Case Files Internal Medicine,246,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 219
20.4 Which one of the following patients should be promptly referred for
endoscopy?
A. A 65-year-old man with new onset of epigastric pain and weight loss
B. A 32-year-old patient whose symptoms are not relieved with ranitidine
C. A 29-year-old H. pylori–positive patient with dyspeptic symptoms
D. A 49-year-old woman with intermittent right upper quadrant pain fol-
lowing meals
ANSWERS
20.1 B. This patient demonstrates risk factors for biliary colic secondary to chole-
lithiasis (4 F’s: “fat, fertile, female, forty”). Acute right upper abdominal pain
occurring after a fatty meal (“fast food”) and producing nausea/vomiting is
most suggestive of biliary colic due to gallstones. Gastric and duodenal ulcers
(answers A and C) cause a gradual, “gnawing/burning” pain, most commonly
located in the midepigastrium. Moreover, the pain associated with duodenal
ulcers is relieved with meals. The patient does not demonstrate risk factors
for acute hepatitis (answer D) such as intravenous drug use, recent travel, and
risky sexual activity.
20.2 E. Helicobacter pylori infection is more common in developing countries
(answer A). It is associated with poor hygiene and transmitted via inges-
tion of the bacteria (contaminated food or water—not sexually [answer D]).
H. pylori is associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma and
MALT lymphoma, not colon cancer (answer B). The association between
H. pylori and nonulcer dyspepsia (answer C) remains unclear. Fewer than
10% of patients with nonulcer dyspepsia improve after H. pylori treatment.
20.3 A. This patient is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension (systolic blood
pressure < 90 mm Hg) and tachycardic because of the acute blood loss.
Immediate volume resuscitation with crystalloid solution (eg, normal saline),
followed by blood transfusion, if necessary, are the best initial steps to prevent
irreversible shock and death. Only after the patient is stabilized would it then
be appropriate to investigate the cause of instability (eg, hemorrhage or ulcer
perforation [answers B, C, and D]).
20.4 A. The patient in answer A has “red flag” symptoms, prompting immediate
endoscopic evaluation: He is older than 45 years and has new-onset symptoms
suggesting possible malignancy (eg, weight loss). The patient in answer B is
young and may benefit from a PPI rather than an H blocker. The patient
2
in answer C is also young and may benefit from triple or quadruple therapy
for H. pylori eradication. If this initial therapy does not improve symptoms,
endoscopic examination would then be appropriate to investigate other
causes of dyspepsia. The patient in answer D is most likely experiencing a
biliary colic. A right upper quadrant ultrasound would be the best next step
in order to evaluate for gallstones.

CLINICAL PEARLS
The most common causes of duodenal and gastric ulcers are H. pylori
»
infection and the use of NSAIDs.
Helicobacter pylori is associated with duodenal and gastric ulcers, chronic
»
active gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric MALT lymphoma.
Treatment of peptic ulcers requires acid suppression with a PPI to heal
»
the ulcer and antibiotic therapy for eradication of H. pylori, if present, to
prevent recurrence.
Patients with dyspepsia who have red flag symptoms (new dyspepsia
»
after the age of 45, weight loss, dysphagia, evidence of bleeding, or ane-
mia) should be referred for endoscopic examination.
Patients without red flag symptoms may undergo noninvasive testing
»
for H. pylori first. The urea breath test may demonstrate active infec-
tion. Serologies may be used only if the patient has never been treated
for H. pylori since antibodies will remain present even after successful
treatment.
Triple or quadruple therapy is used for the treatment of PUD secondary
»
to H. pylori. Triple therapy consists of amoxicillin (or metronidazole if pen-
icillin allergy is present), clarithromycin, and a PPI. Quadruple therapy is
preferred in the setting of suspected clarithromycin-resistant strains of
H. pylori, and it consists of a tetracycline, metronidazole, a bismuth com-
pound, and a PPI.

A 28-year-old man comes to the emergency center complaining of abdominal pain
and diarrhea for 2 days. He claims to defecate frequently, usually 10 to 12 times per
day, consisting of small-volume stools. Blood and mucus are occasionally visualized in
the stool. These episodes are preceded by a sudden urge to defecate. The abdominal
pain is crampy, diffuse, moderately severe, and not relieved with defecation. In the
past 6 to 8 months, he has experienced similar episodes of abdominal pain that
were milder, resolved within 24 to 48 hours, and were associated with loose, mucoid,
bloody stools. He has no other medical history and takes no medications. He has
neither traveled out of the United States nor had contact with anyone experiencing
similar symptoms. He works as an accountant and does not smoke or drink alcohol.
The patient denies any family history of gastrointestinal (GI) problems.
On examination, his temperature is 99 °F, heart rate (HR) is 98 beats per minute
(bpm), and blood pressure (BP) is 118/74 mm Hg. He appears uncomfortable
and is lying still on the stretcher. His sclerae are anicteric, and his oral mucosa is
pink without ulceration. His chest is clear to auscultation, and his heart rhythm
is regular, without murmurs. His abdomen is soft and mildly distended with
hypoactive bowel sounds. There is a mild diffuse tenderness upon palpation, but
no guarding or rebound tenderness is elicited.
Laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of
15,800/mm3 with 82% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL,
and platelet count 754,000/mm3. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
assay is negative. Renal function and liver function tests are normal. A plain
film radiograph of the abdomen shows a mildly dilated, air-filled colon 4.5 cm
in diameter without air-fluid levels or evidence of pneumoperitoneum.

ANSWERS TO CASE 21:
Colitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Summary: A 28-year-old man presents with
Chronic, “crampy” abdominal pain that is not relieved with defecation

Tenesmus

Bloody/mucoid stools

Colon distention, visualized on abdominal x-ray

No history of foreign travel

Most likely diagnosis: Colitis, secondary to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; eg,
ulcerative colitis [UC], Crohn disease [CD]) because the patient is young, experi-
encing crampy abdominal pain not relieved with defecation, bloody/mucoid stools,
and an increase in stool frequency and urgency.
Associated complications: Complications associated with IBD are toxic megacolon,
bowel perforation with peritonitis, abscesses, and fistula formation (eg, entero-
vesical fistula).
Next step to confirm diagnosis: After obtaining stool samples to exclude infection,
colonoscopy would be appropriate to confirm the diagnosis of IBD.
Most appropriate treatment: Admit the patient to the hospital and begin treatment
with corticosteroids (eg, budesonide, prednisone).
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the typical presentation of IBD. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Recognize the differences between CD and UC. (EPA 2, 3)
3. Describe the treatment of IBD. (EPA 4)
Considerations
Although the likelihood in this patient is low, infection must be excluded. Com-
mon organisms that cause colitis are Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella, Shigella,
Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Clostridium difficile, which can occur even in
the absence of prior antibiotic exposure. The main consideration in this case would
be IBD versus infectious colitis. The absence of travel history and sick contacts and
the chronicity of the illness all point away from infection.
This patient does not appear to have any life-threatening complications of coli-
tis, such as a perforation or toxic megacolon. However, close monitoring is impera-
tive, and surgical consultation may be helpful in the event that such complications
arise during hospitalization.

APPROACH TO:
Colitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease
DEFINITIONS
COLITIS: Inflammation of the colon, which may be due to infectious, autoim-
mune, ischemic, or idiopathic causes.
CROHN DISEASE: Inflammatory disease of the bowel that involves the full thick-
ness of the bowel wall and can affect the intestines anywhere from esophagus to
anus, although the ileum is most commonly affected.
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: An autoimmune condition character-
ized by inflammation of the intestinal tract; may be further subdivided into CD
or UC.
TENESMUS: Feeling an urge to defecate.
ULCERATIVE COLITIS: Inflammatory disease affecting the mucosa of the bowel,
principally the large bowel.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO COLITIS
Pathophysiology
The differential diagnosis for colitis includes ischemic colitis, infectious colitis
(C. difficile, E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter), radiation colitis, and
IBD (CD vs UC).
Ischemic colitis (eg, mesenteric colitis) usually presents in people older than
50 years with known atherosclerotic vascular disease (eg, peripheral vascular dis-
ease, coronary artery disease). The pain is usually acute, commonly after a meal
(“intestinal angina”) and not associated with fevers.
Patients with infectious colitis usually present with fever, leukocytosis, abdom-
inal pain, and diarrhea, which may be categorized as either invasive diarrhea
(“dysentery”) or watery diarrhea. The stools associated with dysentery are hem-
orrhagic, appearing grossly bloody (hematochezia) or black/tar-like (melena).
Infectious colitis associated with profuse watery diarrhea is usually indicative
of C. difficile infection and presents in the setting of antibiotic use. The initial
workup for infectious colitis includes stabilizing the patient with normal saline
if hypovolemic shock is present (systolic BP < 90 mm Hg), obtaining a stool
culture, and sampling for bacterial toxins (Shiga toxin, C. difficile toxins).
Radiation enteritis presents as abdominal pain associated with nausea/vomiting,
diarrhea, and lower GI bleeding, 3 or more months after completing radiation
therapy. Imaging studies, such as abdominal computed tomography, or endoscopic
studies (eg, colonoscopy) would demonstrate segmental bowel inflammation in
regions of a known radiation field.

Case Files Internal Medicine,251,"224 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Treatment
Antimicrobial therapy (eg, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin) is recommended for treat-
ment of severe dysentery caused by Campylobacter and entero-hemorrhagic or
entero-toxigenic E. coli. Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of Shiga toxin–
producing strains of E. coli remain controversial. C. difficile infection requires treat-
ment with oral vancomycin. Although antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) may
improve symptoms of watery diarrhea, these agents should be avoided in cases
of bloody diarrhea. Risk factors for infectious colitis include recent history of for-
eign travel (E. histolytica), consumption of raw/undercooked meat (Shigella, E. coli
O157:H7, Salmonella, Campylobacter), and antibiotic use (C. difficile).
CLINICAL APPROACH TO INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Epidemiology
IBD is an autoimmune condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the
intestinal tract. Disease incidence is bimodal, most commonly presenting in young
patients between the ages of 15 and 35, with a second peak between the ages of
60 and 70. Although patients may initially complain of GI symptoms (eg, chronic
abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea), systemic symptoms may also be present, such
as fever, weight loss, and anemia, either due to iron deficiency (chronic GI blood
loss) or anemia of chronic disease. IBD encompasses two major disorders, UC and
CD, each demonstrating their own clinical and pathologic characteristics, yet with
substantial overlap.
Pathophysiology
UC is the most common subtype of IBD and is a chronic inflammatory condition
that is limited to the mucosal and submucosal surface of the colon. The exact mecha-
nism for developing UC remains unclear but is thought to be caused by a dysregu-
lated immune response to a microbial pathogen in the intestine, resulting in colonic
inflammation. The inflammation associated with UC always begins at the rectum, is
circumferential, and extends proximally, involving other portions of the colon in a
continuous pattern. Different terms may be used to describe the degree of colonic
extension. For example, ulcerative proctitis refers to inflammation limited to the
rectum. Ulcerative proctosigmoiditis refers to inflammation limited to the rectum
and sigmoid colon. Left-sided colitis refers to inflammation extending proximally
from the rectum to the splenic flexure. Symptoms of UC progress gradually, con-
sisting of bloody diarrhea, increased stool frequency, urgency, tenesmus, and left
lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain due to rectum/colonic involvement. Abdom-
inal imaging is not required for the diagnosis of UC. However, barium x-rays may
show a “lead pipe colon” due to colonic inflammation and edema. Colonoscopy
with visualization of ulcers is the gold standard for diagnosing UC. Biopsy of these
lesions demonstrates crypt atrophy with polymorphonuclear cell infiltration (“crypt
abscesses”).
CD is the other subtype of IBD and is characterized by transmural inflam-
mation, which may arise at any portion of the GI tract, from the mouth to the
perianal area. Unlike UC, the inflammation in CD is noncontinuous and most

commonly affects the terminal ileum, resulting in right lower quadrant (RLQ)
abdominal pain. Other symptoms associated with CD are fever, weight loss, and
prolonged diarrhea with or without gross bleeding. Like UC, abdominal imaging
is not required to diagnose CD. However, the “string sign” is a classic finding on
barium x-rays, correlating to strictures in the lower GI tract. Endoscopic evalu-
ation with visualization of GI inflammation is the gold standard for diagnos-
ing CD. Grossly, the intestinal lumen classically reveals “cobblestoning” of the
mucosa, with biopsy of these lesions demonstrating noncaseating granulomas.
Tables 21–1 and 21–2 summarize features seen in UC and CD.
Treatment
The treatment for UC is aimed at reducing colonic inflammation and varies
depending on disease severity. For mild-to-moderate inflammation, sulfasalazine
or other 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) compounds, such as mesalamine, are used.
Corticosteroids (oral, rectal, or intravenous) are used for the initial treatment of
severe UC flares and are gradually tapered once remission is achieved to avoid side
effects. Immune modulators (eg, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate,
infliximab) are used for refractory cases, but they may reactivate latent infections
(eg, tuberculosis). Since inflammation is limited to the colon in UC, total colectomy
is curative but is reserved for medically intractable disease, management of acute
complications, or treatment of colorectal cancer/dysplasia.
Treatment of CD is similar to that of UC, but it does have some major differ-
ences. Like UC, remission of an acute CD flare is also achieved with corticosteroids
(eg, budesonide, prednisone), which are tapered once remission is achieved. A thio-
purine (eg, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) or biologic agent (eg, infliximab) may
be added to maintain remission. However, unlike UC, treatment of CD with colec-
tomy is not curative since these lesions may occur at any portion of the GI tract and
are not limited to the colon.

Complications
Ulcerative Colitis. Ulcerative colitis is associated with both acute and chronic com-
plications. Acute complications include severe hemorrhage, fulminant colitis/toxic
megacolon, and colonic perforation. Patients with severe bleeding may present with
hemorrhagic shock (systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) and have anemia. Symptoms asso-
ciated with fulminant colitis include profound increase in stool frequency (> 10
stools/d), abdominal pain, distention, and severe toxic symptoms, such as fever, leu-
kocytosis, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. These patients are at
increased risk for developing toxic megacolon, which is characterized by colonic
diameter > 6 cm or cecal diameter > 9 cm in the presence of systemic toxicity.
Colonic perforation with peritonitis is the most severe complication of UC, usually
resulting from untreated toxic megacolon, and it is associated with 50% mortality
in patients with UC. Management involves providing prompt intravenous fluids and
nasogastric decompression, ensuring the patient receives nothing by mouth (NPO),
and referring for a surgical evaluation for colectomy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
and systemic corticosteroids are also administered to reduce inflammation.
Patients with UC also have a marked increase in the incidence of colon
cancer compared to the general population. The risk of cancer increases over time
and is related to disease duration and extent. Annual or biennial colonoscopy is
advised in patients with UC, beginning 8 years after diagnosis, and random biopsies
should be sent for evaluation. If colon cancer or dysplasia is found, a colectomy is
recommended.
Crohn Disease. Complications associated with CD are fistula formation, perianal
disease, and malabsorption. Chronic transmural inflammation may cause a sinus
tract to gradually form within the bowel wall, which may predispose to fistula
22_Toy-IM_Case21_p221-230.indd 226 25/08/20 9:10 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,254,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 227
formation if the sinus tract penetrates through the serosa and connects to another
epithelial-lined organ. Clinical manifestations of fistula formation vary depend-
ing on organ involvement. For example, fistulas connecting the bowel to bladder
(enterovesical fistulas) present with recurrent urinary tract infections and pneu-
maturia. Enterovaginal fistulas may present with gas or feces emanating from the
vaginal vault.
Other complications associated with CD include perianal disease and malab-
sorption. More than one-third of patients with CD complain of perianal disease.
Symptoms may include large perianal skin tags, fissures, or abscesses, which may
evolve into fistulas. Terminal ileum involvement may cause malabsorption of bile
salts, resulting in deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), and/or malabsorp-
tion of vitamin B , corresponding to megaloblastic anemia with possibly subacute
12
combined degeneration of the spinal cord.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
21.1 A 32-year-old woman is being seen in the office for follow-up of her systemic
inflammatory condition. She has a history of chronic diarrhea and gallstones.
Today, she complains of 3 days’ duration of “brown, foul-smelling discharge”
leaking from her vagina. The clinician believes that the vaginal condition
is related to her primary disease. Which of the following is the most likely
diagnosis?

D. Sarcoidosis
21.2 A 45-year-old man with a history of UC is admitted to the hospital with 2 to
3 weeks of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, jaundice, and pruritus. He
states that he has not had these symptoms previously. He has no fever and
has a normal WBC count. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) shows stricture formation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts
with intervening segments of normal and dilated ducts. Which of the follow-
ing is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
B. Cholangiocarcinoma
C. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)

21.3 A 25-year-old man is hospitalized for an exacerbation of UC. He complains
of abdominal pain and fever. On examination, he is found to have a tem-
perature of 101 °F, HR 110 bpm, and BP 100/60 mm Hg. His abdomen is
distended. On abdominal x-ray, he is noted to have bowel distention with a
transverse colonic dilation of 7 cm. Which of the following is the best next
step?
A. 5-ASA
B. Oral steroids
C. Intravenous antibiotics and prompt surgical consultation
D. Infliximab
21.4 A 35-year-old woman complains of chronic crampy abdominal pain, intermit-
tent constipation, and diarrhea. She denies weight loss or GI bleeding. Her
abdominal pain is usually relieved with defection. Colonoscopy and upper
endoscopy with biopsies are normal, and stool cultures are negative. Which
of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Infectious colitis
B. Irritable bowel syndrome
C. Crohn disease
D. Ulcerative colitis
ANSWERS
21.1 A. This patient likely has an enterovaginal fistula based on the history of stool
leaking into the vaginal area. Fistulas (eg, rectovaginal fistulas) are common
with CD because of transmural inflammation. Fistulas can occur between
bowel, between the bowel and other organs (bladder, vagina), or between the
bowel and skin (enterocutaneous). In contrast, the mucosal inflammation
seen in UC (answer B) is not associated with fistulas. Gallstones are common in
patients with CD due to bile salt malabsorption, which is necessary to increase
cholesterol solubility in bile. Systemic lupus erythematosus (answer C) is more
commonly associated with joint pain, alopecia, serositis, rash, anemia, cen-
tral nervous system findings, and renal dysfunction. Sarcoidosis (answer D)
is associated with pulmonary findings such as shortness of breath and cough,
neurologic manifestations, and systemic findings (fever, weight loss). Neither
systemic lupus erythematosus nor sarcoidosis is associated with fistulas.
21.2 C. The ERCP shows the typical appearance for PSC, which is associated
with IBD (predominantly UC) in 75% of cases. PSC is more common in
men. Antibodies against perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
(p-ANCA) are also common. Stone-induced strictures such as those due to
choledocholithiasis (answer D) are extrahepatic and unifocal. Cholangio-
carcinoma (answer B) is less common but may develop in 10% of patients
22_Toy-IM_Case21_p221-230.indd 228 25/08/20 9:10 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,256,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 229
with PSC. PBC (answer A) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by
destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, presenting with jaundice and extensive
pruritus secondary to cholestasis. PBC is more common in women and is
associated with antimitochondrial antibodies.
21.3 C. Colonic dilation greater than or equal to 6 cm with signs of systemic tox-
icity (ie, fever) makes the diagnosis of toxic megacolon more likely. With
toxic megacolon, antibiotics and surgical intervention are often necessary
and lifesaving. Medical therapy includes bowel rest with total parenteral
nutrition, intravenous steroids, and antibiotics. Sulfasalazine and 5-ASA
compounds (answer A) are not recommended for the treatment of toxic
megacolon. The other answer choices are medical therapy (answer B, oral ste-
roids and answer D, infliximab) and would only delay addressing the possible
emergency.
21.4 B. Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by intermittent diarrhea and/or
constipation and crampy abdominal pain often relieved with defecation.
Weight loss, fecal blood, and intestinal biopsies are negative. It is a diagnosis
of exclusion once other conditions, such as IBD and parasitic infection (eg,
giardiasis), have been excluded. The other diseases (answer A, infectious coli-
tis; answer C, Crohn disease; answer D, ulcerative colitis) are associated with
fever, weight loss and systemic symptoms.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Ulcerative colitis always involves the rectum and may extend proximally
»
in a continuous distribution.
Crohn disease most commonly involves the distal ileum, but it may
»
involve any portion of the GI tract in a noncontinuous (“skip lesions”)
distribution.
Crohn disease is often complicated by fistula formation and malabsorp-
»
tion of fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin B .
12
Toxic megacolon is associated with UC and characterized by dilation of
»
the colon with symptoms of systemic toxicity; failure to improve with
medical therapy may require surgical intervention.
Ulcerative colitis is associated with increased risk of colon cancer; the risk
»
increases with duration and extent of disease.
Both UC and CD can be associated with extraintestinal manifestations,
»
such as uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, arthritis,
and PSC.

A 61-year-old man comes to the emergency center complaining of 3 days of
worsening abdominal pain. The pain is localized to the left lower quadrant of his
abdomen. It began as an intermittent crampy pain and now has become steady
and moderately severe. He feels nauseated, but he has not vomited. He had a
small loose stool at the beginning of this illness, but he has had not had any bowel
movements over past 2 days. He has never experienced these symptoms before,
and he does not have any history of gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses.
On examination, his temperature is 100.2 °F, heart rate is 98 beats per minute
(bpm), and blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg. He has no pallor or jaundice. His
chest is clear, and his heart rhythm is regular without murmurs. His abdomen is
mildly distended with hypoactive bowel sounds and marked left lower quadrant
tenderness with voluntary guarding. Rectal examination reveals tenderness, and
his stool is negative for occult blood.
Laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell count of 12,800/mm3 with
74% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 22% lymphocytes, and a normal hemoglobin
and hematocrit. A plain film of the abdomen shows no pneumoperitoneum and a
nonspecific bowel gas pattern.

ANSWERS TO CASE 22:
Acute Diverticulitis
Summary: A 61-year-old man presents with
A 3-day history of worsening new-onset abdominal pain

Low-grade fever

Abdominal distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and voluntary guarding

Leukocytosis with normal hemoglobin and no occult blood

Normal x-ray of the abdomen

Most likely diagnosis: Acute sigmoid diverticulitis.
Risk factors: Frequent red meat consumption, Western diet, and low-fiber diets.
Most appropriate next steps: This patient shows voluntary guarding, which is con-
cerning for peritoneal inflammation, likely due to complicated diverticulitis. The
patient should be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics, imaging, and
close monitoring. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen will be very
useful to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude pericolic abscess or other complica-
tions, such as fistula formation.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the complications of diverticular disease. (EPA 1, 10)
2. Recognize the appropriate therapy of acute diverticulitis, which is depen-
dent on the age of the patient and the severity of the disease presentation.
(EPA 1, 4)
3. List the complications of diverticulitis and the indications for surgical inter-
vention. (EPA 4, 10)
4. Differentiate between inpatient and outpatient management of diverticulitis.
(EPA 1, 2, 9)
5. Discuss strategies for prevention and follow-up in acute diverticulitis.
(EPA 7, 12)
Considerations
This 61-year-old man presents with new-onset, progressively worsening, severe,
lower left abdominal pain. The most likely diagnosis is acute diverticulitis, but the
differential diagnosis for these symptoms is broad; several key diagnoses that carry
significant morbidity and mortality for the patient must be excluded. These include
bowel perforation, ischemic colitis, and colon cancer. This patient had an x-ray
that showed no free air in the abdomen. This makes pneumoperitoneum secondary
to bowel perforation, which is a surgical emergency, less likely. Ischemic colitis
23_Toy-IM_Case22_p231-240.indd 232 25/08/20 9:12 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,260,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 233
is another diagnostic consideration in an older patient, but it usually is associated
with signs of bleeding and a history of atherosclerotic disease and pain out of pro-
portion to the physical examination findings. As colon cancer can present with
abdominal pain and bleeding per rectum, the patient must receive age-appropriate
colon cancer screening once acute diverticulitis has resolved.
APPROACH TO:
Diverticulitis
DEFINITIONS
COLONIC DIVERTICULUM: Herniation of the mucosa and submucosa through
a weakness of the muscle lining of the colon.
DIVERTICULITIS: Inflammation of a colonic diverticulum, typically on the left
colon, such as the sigmoid.
DIVERTICULOSIS: Presence of diverticular disease in the colon without inflam-
mation; it is often asymptomatic or may present with painless bright red rectal
bleeding.
RECURRENT DIVERTICULITIS: Subsequent diverticulitis episode(s) after the
resolution of the first attack of acute diverticulitis, which may not be as severe.
SMOLDERING DIVERTICULITIS: Symptomatic, uncomplicated diverticulitis
that persists after the initial episode and is refractory to medical treatment.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Diverticulosis is extremely common, affecting 50% to 80% of people older than
80 years. Colonic diverticula are, in fact, pseudodiverticula through weakness in
the muscle lining, typically at areas of vascular penetration to the smooth mus-
cle. Therefore, their walls do not contain the muscle layers surrounding the colon.
They are typically 5 to 10 mm in diameter and occur mainly in the distal colon.
The development of diverticula has been linked to insufficient dietary fiber, lead-
ing to a slower colonic transit and increased resting colonic intraluminal pressure.
Most patients will remain asymptomatic. Some patients, however, will have chronic
symptoms (eg, nonspecific lower abdominal pain aggravated by eating and relieved
upon defecation, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea) resembling those of irritable
bowel syndrome. A patient with diverticulosis may even present with acute symp-
toms that could be confused with acute diverticulitis, but upon further workup
there is no evidence of inflammation. This entity has been named “painful diver-
ticular disease without diverticulitis.”
Acute diverticulitis is a common complication of diverticulosis, developing
in approximately 20% of all patients with diverticula. The risk of diverticulitis
is increased in patients who use medications such as aspirin and nonsteroidal

anti-inflammatory drugs, patients who are obese, or those who lead sedentary
lifestyles. Patients often present with acute abdominal pain and signs of perito-
neal irritation localizing to the left lower quadrant, often presenting like “left-sided
appendicitis.” Inspissated stool particles (fecaliths) appear to obstruct the diver-
ticular neck, causing more inflammation and diminished venous outflow, as well as
bacterial overgrowth, which ultimately leads to abrasion and perforation of the thin
diverticular wall. Most cases are uncomplicated and may be medically managed in
an outpatient setting, but 25% of cases develop complications that may require
hospitalization or surgical intervention (Table 22–1).
Clinical Presentation
Patients usually present with visceral pain that localizes later to the left lower quad-
rant and may be associated with fever, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea, or con-
stipation. A right lower quadrant presentation would not exclude this diagnosis
because diverticulitis can also affect the ascending colon or cecum. On examina-
tion, the patient may have localized left lower quadrant tenderness or more diffuse
abdominal tenderness with peritoneal irritation signs, such as guarding or rebound
tenderness. The patient may also have a palpable mass or abdominal distension
on examination. On rectal examination, the patient may exhibit tenderness if
there is an abscess present. Laboratory testing will show neutrophil-predominant
leukocytosis.
Plain film radiographs, including abdominal erect and supine films with a chest
x-ray, are routinely performed but usually are not diagnostic. These films can help
to identify patients with pneumoperitoneum and assess their cardiopulmonary
status, especially in patients with other comorbid conditions. Barium enemas are
contraindicated for fear of perforation and spillage of contrast into the abdominal
cavity, a catastrophic complication. Endoscopy is also relatively contraindicated in
the acute phase due to risk of perforation and usually is reserved for use at least
6 weeks after resolution of the acute episode. The purpose of the colonoscopy is to
confirm the presence of diverticuli and to exclude colonic neoplasia.
CT scan is typically the preferred modality of choice for diagnosing diver-
ticulitis. Findings consistent with diverticulitis include inflamed sigmoid diver-
ticula, thickening of the bowel wall to more than 4 mm, pericolic fat stranding
signifying inflammation, or the finding of a diverticular abscess. Although these
findings have high specificity for diverticulitis, they have low sensitivity, and
only 50% of patients will have these characteristics on CT. Pregnant patients

can undergo ultrasonography to avoid the harmful effects of ionizing radiation
to the fetus.
Treatment
Outpatient Therapy. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can usually be man-
aged conservatively with bowel rest and antibiotics. Select patients with less severe
presentation, ability to tolerate oral antibiotic medications, and absence of signifi-
cant comorbid conditions may be managed as outpatients. There is weak evidence
supporting the use of antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated diverticulitis. Several
studies showed that antibiotics do not affect recovery time or prevent future com-
plications in uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, antibiotics are often prescribed
as a part of the standard practice. Antibiotic therapy should cover a broad spectrum
and should especially target gram-negative rods and anaerobes. Oral antibiotics
may include a quinolone plus metronidazole, or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7 to
10 days. Patients should be instructed to take clear liquids only and advance their
diet slowly only if clinical improvement is evident after 2 to 3 days.
Inpatient Therapy. Factors that advocate for inpatient therapy include elderly
or immunosuppressed patients, those with significant comorbidities, those with
high fever or significant leukocytosis, and those in need for narcotics to control
pain. Patients requiring hospitalization can be treated with clear liquids or given
nothing by mouth (NPO) with intravenous hydration, depending on the severity
of symptoms. Intravenous empiric antibiotics with broad-spectrum activity against
gram-negative rods and anaerobic organisms such as piperacillin/tazobactam or
ceftriaxone plus metronidazole should be started. Pain, fever, and leukocytosis are
expected to diminish with appropriate management in the first few days of treat-
ment, at which point the dietary intake can be advanced gradually. CT imaging
is indicated to identify complications (Table 22–2), such as abscess, stricture, or
obstruction in the patient with persistent fever or pain. The patient can be dis-
charged once able to tolerate an oral diet, their vital signs are stable, and their
abdominal pain has resolved.
Surgical Therapy. Surgical management such as sigmoid resection is indicated for
low surgical risk patients with complicated diverticulitis. Patients who have suffered
two or more episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis are often treated surgically,
but medical management may also be continued without increased risk of perfora-
tion. Indications for emergent surgical intervention include generalized peritonitis,
uncontrolled sepsis, perforation, and clinical deterioration. Surgical interventions
include abdominal washout, CT-guided percutaneous drainage of abscesses, and
bowel resection.
Prevention and Recurrence. Once the acute phase has resolved, medical man-
agement to prevent symptoms includes a high-fiber diet, anti-inflammatory medi-
cations such as mesalamine for chronic low-grade inflammation, and probiotics.
Treatment of diverticulosis consists of changing dietary habits, especially increas-
ing fiber intake. Avoidance of nuts or foods with small seeds (eg, strawberries)
is traditionally advised, although data supporting this recommendation is lack-
ing. Patients should be encouraged to exercise routinely and counseled to stop
smoking. Colonoscopy is commonly performed at least 6 weeks after an attack

of diverticulitis to evaluate for colorectal carcinoma, which may mimic the clinical
presentation of diverticulitis.
Some patients may continue to have symptoms after an initial attack, leading
to a subacute phase called “smoldering diverticulitis.” These patients may develop
chronic symptoms that last longer than 6 months without progressing to acute
diverticulitis or other complications. About a third of the patients with one episode
of diverticulitis will develop recurrent disease. Though those with uncomplicated
diverticulitis are not at increased risk of recurrence, patients with complicated dis-
ease are 1.5 times more likely to develop recurrence. Patients without significant
other comorbidities who have chronic smoldering diverticulitis or recurrent or
complicated diverticulitis should be offered surgical intervention.
Complications
Complications include hemorrhage and obstruction. Diverticular hemorrhage is
the most common cause of hematochezia in patients older than 60 years and typi-
cally presents as painless passage of bright red blood. Only 20% of patients with
diverticulosis will experience GI bleeding. Generally, hemorrhage is abrupt in
onset and resolution. The diagnosis may be established by finding diverticula on
23_Toy-IM_Case22_p231-240.indd 236 25/08/20 9:12 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,264,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 237
colonoscopy without other pathology. Most diverticular hemorrhages are self-limited,
and treatment is supportive, with intravenous fluid or blood product transfusion
as needed. For patients with recurrent or chronic bleeding, resection of the
affected colonic segment may be indicated. Bowel obstruction is rare and can be due
to acute inflammation leading to partial obstruction of the bowel lumen or, less com-
monly, chronic inflammation leading to stricture formation. Sometimes surgical
therapy is needed if medical treatment is ineffective.

ANSWERS
22.1 A. This patient has complicated diverticulitis, with recurrent disease (as
defined by two or more complicated episodes); she is a low surgical risk and
thus should be evaluated for resection. Barium enema (answer C) is contra-
indicated due to risk of perforation, and dietary recommendations regarding
nuts and seeds (answer D) are unsupported by data. Colonoscopy (answer B)
should be postponed until at least 6 weeks after the acute case of diverticulitis
to avoid perforation.
22.2 C. This patient has right lower abdominal tenderness and fever, which is most
likely due to acute appendicitis. The most common cause of an acute abdo-
men at any age is appendicitis. Ischemic bowel (answer D) usually presents
with severe abdominal pain out of proportion to abdominal examination
findings and often with a history of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Sepsis
due to a urinary tract infection (answer E) is a common cause of septic shock
and hypotension, but it usually does not cause abdominal findings; flank ten-
derness or merely generalized sepsis is more common.
22.3 C. CT imaging is the modality of choice in evaluating diverticulitis. Barium
enema (answer A) and endoscopy tend to increase intraluminal pressure and
can worsen diverticulitis or lead to colonic rupture. Colonoscopy and flexible
sigmoidoscopy (answer B) are also contraindicated in the acute setting and
should be delayed until 6 weeks after to rule out a neoplasm. Observation
(answer E) is not appropriate in this patient before a complete evaluation is
performed.
22.4 B. This patient has ischemic colitis, which is suggested by his acute presen-
tation of bloody stools, diffuse abdominal pain, absent bowel sounds, and
hypotension. This patient has several risk factors for ischemic colitis, such
as coronary artery disease and history of aortic aneurysm repair (weaken-

angiodysplasia are common causes of lower GI bleeds, they do not usually
present with severe abdominal pain and shock, and the patient usually has a
history of renal disease. Colorectal cancer (answer D) is a chronic condition
that may present with lower GI bleed, anemia, changes in bowel habits, and
weight loss.

Regardless of the etiology, this patient should be treated within 1 hour
(optimally after blood and urine cultures). Treatment includes intravenous
antibiotics that are broad spectrum and target gram-negative rods as well
as anaerobic bacteria, intravenous fluids, and serum lactate level. A CT scan

A 38-year-old man without a significant medical history presents for an evaluation.
He reports a 9- to 12-month history of intermittent diarrhea associated with mild
cramping. He reports that his stools are usually large volume, nonbloody, and
greasy. He has unintentionally lost more than 20 lb during this period but says that
his appetite and oral intake have been good. He has tried taking a proton pump
inhibitor daily for the last several months, but it has not improved his symptoms.
He also tried refraining from any intake of dairy products, but that did not affect
the diarrhea either. He has not experienced fever or any other constitutional
symptoms. He does not smoke and drinks an occasional beer on the weekends,
but not regularly. He is married, is monogamous, and does not know his family
medical history due to being adopted.
On examination, he is afebrile, normotensive, and comfortable appearing.
He has some glossitis but no oral lesions. His chest is clear to auscultation,
and his heart is regular in rate and rhythm. On abdominal examination, his
bowel sounds are active; no tenderness, masses, or organomegaly are evident
on palpation. Rectal examination is negative for occult blood. He has some
patches of papulovesicular lesions on his elbows, knees, and abdomen with some
excoriations; he says it is very itchy.

ANSWERS TO CASE 23:
Chronic Diarrhea
Summary: A 38-year-old man presents with
Chronic diarrhea

Nonbloody, greasy stools suggestive of fat malabsorption

Unintentional weight loss without systemic symptoms

Glossitis suggestive of vitamin deficiency

Rash on extensor surfaces consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis (papules and blis-

ters that are very itchy)
Most likely diagnosis: Chronic diarrhea due to celiac disease.
Next step in management: Check serum tissue transglutaminase (tTG)–Ig (immu-
noglobulin) A and endomysial (EMA)–IgA antibody.
Best diagnostic test: Endoscopic examination with small-bowel biopsy.
Risk Factors: Family history of celiac disease, autoimmune conditions (type 1 dia-
betes, autoimmune thyroiditis), Down syndrome, Turner syndrome.
Best treatment: Adherence to a gluten-free diet to improve small-intestine mucosal
morphology.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the initial evaluation and management of acute infectious diarrhea.
(EPA 1, 3, 4)
2. List the indications for antibiotic treatment of acute diarrhea. (EPA 4)
3. Recognize the pathophysiology of chronic diarrhea. (EPA 2, 12)
4. Understand the diagnosis, management, and complications of celiac disease.
(EPA 1, 4, 10)
Considerations
This patient has chronic diarrhea with worrisome features such as weight loss and
nutritional deficiency secondary to malabsorption. It is important to distinguish
between functional causes of chronic diarrhea, such as irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS), and more significant causes of diarrhea, such as inflammatory diseases and
malabsorption, that may lead to complications or adverse long-term sequelae. Some
of the red flags that indicate a pathologic etiology include weight loss, fever, fatigue,
bloody diarrhea, systemic symptoms such as joint pain, and nutritional deficien-
cies. Celiac disease, an autoimmune sensitivity to gluten, is an important diagnosis
to consider because the clinical manifestations may be subtle. This patient’s rash,
which is very suspicious for dermatitis herpetiformis (raised red papules that can

erupt into blisters and is very pruritic), is strongly associated with celiac disease.
Once a diagnosis is established, most patients can be managed with dietary modi-
fication to improve symptoms and prevent complications.
APPROACH TO:
Diarrhea
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE DIARRHEA: Diarrhea of duration less than 14 days.
CELIAC DISEASE: Small-bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of malab-
sorption and an abnormal small-bowel biopsy; it occurs with exposure to dietary
gluten and improves after elimination of gluten from the diet.
CHRONIC DIARRHEA: Diarrhea of more than a 4 weeks’ duration; it is some-
times called persistent diarrhea.
DIARRHEA: Passage of abnormally liquid or unformed stool at increased
frequency.
INFLAMMATORY DIARRHEA: Diarrhea that can be osmotic, secretory, or
mixed in presentation and presents with systemic symptoms.
INVASIVE DIARRHEA: Diarrhea consisting of bloody stools or mucus; it is also
called dysentery. This may occur with fever and abdominal pain.
OSMOTIC DIARRHEA: Diarrhea that occurs due to water drawn into the gut
lumen by a poorly absorbed or unabsorbed substance. This type of diarrhea has a
high stool osmotic gap.
SECRETORY DIARRHEA: Diarrhea that results from secretion of water and elec-
trolytes or decreased absorption and is characterized by a low stool osmotic gap.
STEATORRHEA: Characterized by greasy or oily stools that are difficult to
flush. Patients with steatorrhea may often have nutritional deficiency secondary to
malabsorption.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO ACUTE DIARRHEA
Pathophysiology
Diarrheal illnesses are extremely common, affecting nearly one in three people
in the United States each year. In developing countries, acute infectious diarrhea
is one of the leading causes of mortality. In the developed world, 90% of cases of
acute diarrhea are infectious, but the large majority of those illnesses are mild and
self-limited. Most causes of acute diarrhea in developed countries do not require
antibiotic treatment and resolve with symptomatic treatment. High-risk groups
include travelers, immunocompromised patients, and people who are hospitalized
or institutionalized.
24_Toy-IM_Case23_p241-254.indd 243 25/08/20 9:13 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,271,"244 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Most patients with mild-to-moderate illness do not require specific evaluation,
and their symptoms can be managed with an oral sugar-electrolyte solution or
with antimotility agents such as loperamide. Bismuth subsalicylate can also reduce
symptoms of nausea and diarrhea. A more severe illness is suggested by any of
the following findings: profuse watery diarrhea with signs of hypovolemia, grossly
bloody stools, fever, symptoms lasting longer than 48 hours, severe abdominal pain,
age > 70, hospitalization, or recent use of antibiotics.
For these patients, an evaluation should be performed to distinguish between
inflammatory and noninflammatory causes of diarrhea. Routine evaluation includes
testing for fecal leukocytes or fecal lactoferrin (a more sensitive marker of fecal
leukocytes) and performing a routine stool culture (for Salmonella, Shigella, and
Campylobacter). Additional testing might include the following:
Examination of stool for ova and parasites, which may be considered in cases

of persistent diarrhea, especially if the patient has exposure to infants in a
day care setting (Giardia, Cryptosporidium) or if there is a known community
waterborne outbreak of these infections.
Nonroutine cultures, such as for Escherichia coli O157:H7, may be performed

in cases of acute bloody diarrhea, especially if there is a known local outbreak
or if the patient develops hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
Stool may also be tested for the Clostridium difficile toxin in patients with recent

antibiotic use.
Treatment
Patients with inflammatory diarrhea may present with bloody stools, fever, or
other signs suggestive of invasive bacterial or viral infections. The most common
etiologies of inflammatory diarrhea are Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella,
Entamoeba histolytica, and E. coli O157:H7. A patient with suspected inflamma-
tory diarrhea often receives empiric antibiotics such as quinolones. An exception
to this strategy is in patients with suspected enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)
infection. There is no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for EHEC infections,
such as those caused by the O157:H7 strain. Antibiotics are not recommended
due to concerns for increased risk of HUS from an increase in the production of
Shiga toxin.
If testing suggests a noninflammatory diarrhea, most cases are due to viral infec-
tion (Norwalk, rotavirus) food poisoning (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus,
Clostridium perfringens) or giardiasis. Viral infections and food poisoning are gen-
erally self-limited and are treated with supportive care. Giardiasis is treated with
metronidazole or tinidazole.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO CHRONIC DIARRHEA
Unlike acute diarrhea, most cases of chronic diarrhea are not infectious. To evaluate
and manage patients with chronic diarrhea, it is useful to classify the causes of chronic
diarrhea by their pathophysiologic mechanism (Table 23–1 and Figure 23–1).

Abbreviation: VIPoma, vasoactive intestinal peptide tumor.
Secretory Diarrhea
Secretory diarrhea is caused by a disruption of the water and electrolyte transport
across the intestinal epithelium. The diarrhea is typically described as large volume,
watery, without significant abdominal pain, and with no evidence of stool fat or fecal
leukocytes. Secretory diarrhea can occur while the patient is fasting or asleep.
Hormone-producing tumors are less common but important causes of secre-
tory diarrhea. Carcinoid tumors typically arise in the small bowel and may present
with diarrhea, episodic flushing, wheezing from bronchospasm, and right-sided
heart failure. Diagnosis is established by demonstration of elevated serotonin lev-
els, usually through finding high concentrations of its metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-
acetic acid (5-HIAA) in a 24-hour urine collection. Gastrinomas are uncommon

neuroendocrine tumors that are usually located in the pancreas. These tumors
secrete gastrin, which causes high gastric acid levels and manifests as recurrent
peptic ulcers and diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea may be the presenting feature in 10% of
cases. Initial diagnostic testing includes finding a markedly elevated fasting gastrin
level. VIPoma is a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP) as well as other peptide hormones that cause profuse,
sometimes massive, watery diarrhea with profound dehydration and hypokalemia,
as gastrointestinal (GI) secretions are rich in potassium.
Osmotic Diarrhea
Osmotic diarrhea occurs with ingestion of large amounts of poorly absorbed,
osmotically active solute that draws water into the intestinal lumen. Common sol-
utes include unabsorbed carbohydrates (sorbitol, lactulose, or lactose in patients
with lactase deficiency), orlistat, or divalent ions (magnesium or sulfate, often used
in laxatives). Low fecal pH < 6 suggests carbohydrate malabsorption. Other fea-
tures of osmotic diarrhea include a high stool osmotic gap (> 75 mOsm/kg) and
low sodium concentration (< 70 mEq/L). The fecal water output is proportional to
the solute load, so the diarrhea can be large or small volume. An important clinical
clue to distinguish between osmotic and secretory diarrhea is that secretory diar-
rhea will persist during a 24- to 28-hour fast, whereas osmotic diarrhea should abate
with fasting or when the patient stops ingesting the poorly absorbed solute.
The most common cause of osmotic diarrhea is lactose intolerance, which affects
the large majority of the world’s nonwhite population and approximately 20% to
30% of the US population. Most people lose the brush border lactase enzyme with
age and can no longer digest lactose by adulthood. Diagnosis is made clinically, by
history, and with a trial of lactose avoidance. Symptoms are managed by avoiding
dairy products or providing supplementation with oral lactase enzyme.
Inflammatory Diarrhea
Inflammatory diarrhea is characterized by systemic symptoms such as fever,
abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. Stool studies will typically show fecal leu-
kocytes and an elevation of fecal calprotectin, which is released by neutrophils. The
most common and important causes are the inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcer-
ative colitis and Crohn disease. Microscopic colitis is another cause of inflamma-
tory diarrhea that occurs in older adults and presents with frequent watery stools.
Colonoscopy usually reveals normal colonic mucosa macroscopically, while biopsy
shows lymphocytic infiltration.
Dysmotility
Dysmotility represents altered bowel motility due to a secondary cause, such as
hyperthyroidism, prokinetic medications, or visceral autonomic dysregulation like
diabetes. An extremely common but poorly understood dysmotility disorder is
IBS. It is characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits with-
out a clear organic cause. Pain is typically relieved with defecation, and there is
often mucus discharge with stools and a sensation of incomplete voiding. Pres-
ence of any of the following findings is not characteristic of IBS and should prompt
24_Toy-IM_Case23_p241-254.indd 247 25/08/20 9:13 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,275,"248 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
investigation for an organic cause of diarrhea: large-volume diarrhea, bloody stools,
greasy stools, significant weight loss, anemia, occult or overt GI bleeding, or noc-
turnal awakening with pain or diarrhea.
Malabsorption/Steatorrhea
Malabsorption, or impaired absorption of nutrients, can be caused by either intra-
luminal maldigestion or mucosal epithelial defects. In conditions causing malab-
sorption, steatorrhea is commonly assessed as an indicator of global malabsorption
primarily because the process of fat absorption is complex and is sensitive to inter-
ference from absorptive disease processes. Significant fat malabsorption produces
greasy, foul-smelling diarrhea. Hydroxylation by gut bacteria leads to increased
concentration of intraluminal fatty acids, causing an osmotic effect and increased
stool output.
The most common cause of intraluminal maldigestion is pancreatic exocrine
insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis, most often due to alcohol abuse. Patients
present with chronic abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and pancreatic calcifications on
imaging and may often have diabetes due to pancreatic endocrine dysfunction and
insulin deficiency. Other causes of chronic pancreatitis include hypertriglyceride-
mia, smoking, cystic fibrosis, and autoimmune pancreatitis. Treatment of malab-
sorption is with oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation.
The most common and important cause of mucosal malabsorption is celiac dis-
ease. It was originally described in pediatric patients with severe diarrhea and fail-
ure to thrive. It is now understood that this condition is much more common than
previously recognized and affects approximately 1% of the population, with highest
incidence in people of northern European ancestry. Patients with severe disease
may present with classic manifestations of malabsorption: greasy, voluminous,
foul-smelling stools; weight loss; severe microcytic anemia; neurologic disorders
from deficiencies of B vitamins; and osteopenia from deficiency of vitamin D and
calcium. However, this spectrum of findings is relatively uncommon, even in gener-
alized mucosal disease. Adult patients with undiagnosed celiac disease rarely present
with profuse diarrhea and severe metabolic disturbances. The majority of patients
have relatively mild GI symptoms, which often mimic more common disorders,
such as IBS, and may present solely with symptoms that are attributable to a nutri-
tional deficiency or watery diarrhea. For example, patients with unexplained iron
deficiency anemia, especially if it fails to correct adequately with iron supplementa-
tion, should be suspected to have celiac disease.
The exact pathophysiology of celiac disease is uncertain, but the current under-
standing is that genetically predisposed individuals, especially those with HLA-
DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 gene subtypes, develop this immune disorder that is triggered
by exposure to the gliadin component of gluten, which is a protein composite found
in foods processed from wheat and related grain species like barley and rye.
In patients for whom there is a high clinical suspicion of disease, one should pro-
ceed to endoscopic evaluation with small-bowel biopsy, and a serologic evaluation. On
an endoscopic examination, patients have characteristic mucosal changes involving
24_Toy-IM_Case23_p241-254.indd 248 25/08/20 9:13 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,276,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 249
villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the proximal small bowel. IgA anti-EMA
antibodies and anti- tTG antibodies are highly specific and reasonably sensitive tests
for celiac disease. However, antigliadin antibodies have a lower specificity (between
2% and 12%). Patients who have no family history of celiac disease or no clinical
or laboratory evidence of malabsorption have a low clinical suspicion of disease. In
those cases, only serologic evaluation is sufficient for diagnosis. Negative serology
adequately excludes the diagnosis in such patients. Note that all testing should be
done with patients on a gluten-rich diet for at least several weeks, as the mucosal
abnormalities may disappear and serologic titers fall after gluten withdrawal from
the diet.
The mainstay of treatment of celiac disease is adherence to a gluten-free diet.
Referral to a nutritionist may be appropriate, and there are a number of gluten-free
foods that are commercially available. In addition, nutritional deficiencies should
be corrected, and patients should be evaluated for bone loss using a dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometric (DEXA) scan. Patients with celiac disease may also have a
higher risk of GI tract malignancies and T-cell lymphoma, so one should maintain
a high index of suspicion.

ANSWERS
23.1 A. This patient’s symptoms are most suggestive of IBS. IBS is diagnosed based
on the Rome IV criteria, which include abdominal pain at least 1 day per
week for at least 3 months associated with two or more of the following cri-
teria: (1) pain related to defecation, (2) change in frequency of stool, and
(3) change in appearance of stool. IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion and should
not be made if the patient has “alarm” symptoms (hematochezia, weight loss,
anemia). This patient has mucus in her stools, which is a common com-
plaint. IBS causes altered gut motility, although the pathophysiology is not
clear. Transmural inflammation (answer B) is seen in Crohn disease, which
would also present with systemic symptoms. Lactose intolerance is caused by
decreased absorption of disaccharides (answer C). Chronic pancreatitis pres-
ents with exocrine insufficiency and maldigestion (answer D). Celiac disease
causes an immunologic response to gliadin, which leads to crypt hyperplasia
and villous atrophy (answer E).
23.2 B. This patient presents with voluminous watery diarrhea, dehydration,
weight loss, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia, which suggest VIPoma. VIPo-
mas are caused by autonomous VIP secretion leading to stimulation of intes-
tinal epithelial cells and fluid secretion into the lumen. This tumor can lead
to iron and vitamin B deficiencies. The best initial step to confirm diagnosis
12
is to obtain a serum VIP level. After diagnosis is confirmed, a CT scan of the
abdomen (answer A) is usually obtained to confirm location of the tumor
as well as help with staging; an initial CT scan is not indicated without a
diagnosis. DOTATATE scans (answer C) and somatostatin receptor scin-
tigraphy (answer D) are used if other imaging is inconclusive. In addition to
initial workup and repletion of electrolytes, this patient may require testing
for multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome. The other answer choices,
endoscopic ultrasound (answer E) and exploratory laparotomy (answer F),
are not useful for this condition.
23.3 C. While GI symptoms in a patient with a family history of celiac disease
are reasonable to investigate, the fact that he has been on a gluten-free diet
for a prolonged period greatly diminishes the sensitivity of both endoscopic
and serologic testing. Unexplained osteopenia and vitamin D deficiency in a
young woman (answer A), unexplained iron deficiency anemia (answer D)
in any patient, and the classic presentation with steatorrhea and weight loss
(answer B) should all be investigated.
23.4 E. Acute diarrhea that progresses to bloody diarrhea and a history of recent
travel suggests EHEC infection. Empiric antibiotics (answers A-D) are not
used in EHEC infections due to the risk of developing HUS. Although there
is less data in adults, the risk for HUS in children rises as high as 25% when
treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics have also not been shown to reduce GI
upset symptoms. The best treatment for a patient with suspected EHEC
infection is supportive care with isotonic fluids.

A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a
4-week history of progressive abdominal swelling and diffuse discomfort. He
has no other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. He is a construction worker who
spends at least 8 hours a day working outside. He reports that he drinks beer
when he gets thirsty, usually drinking 12 cans per day. He states that he never
felt the need to stop drinking alcohol. He denies illicit intravenous drug use.
Over the last few months, he has noted dark colored urine, but he has not seen
skin or mucosal color changes. On examination, his temperature is 100.3 °F,
heart rate is 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. He is thin
appearing, with telangiectasias noted on his cheeks and upper anterior chest.
Yellow discoloration can be seen under his tongue and on his sclera but is not
evident on his skin. His heart and lung examinations are unremarkable. The
abdomen is distended, with mild diffuse tenderness, hypoactive bowel sounds,
diffuse dullness to percussion, and a fluid wave. He has no peripheral or pitting
edema. Laboratory studies are normal except for Na 129 mEq/L (normal 135-145);
albumin 2.8 g/dL (normal 3.5-5 g/dL); total bilirubin 2 mg/dL; prothrombin time
15 seconds (normal 11-13.5); hemoglobin 11 g/dL with mean cell volume 102 fL

ANSWERS TO CASE 24B:
Liver Cirrhosis, Probably Alcoholic
Summary: A 60-year-old man presents with
New, progressive abdominal distention

Heavy alcohol use daily

Scleral and mucosal icterus with physical findings consistent with ascites

Low serum albumin and sodium

Bilirubin slightly elevated

Low platelet count and macrocytic anemia

Most likely diagnosis: Ascites caused by portal hypertension as a complication of
hepatic cirrhosis, most likely related to alcohol abuse.
Next step: Perform a diagnostic paracentesis to evaluate the fluid to determine the
likely etiology of the ascites, as well as evaluate for a known possible complication
of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Explain how liver cirrhosis is diagnosed. (EPA 1, 3)
2. Recognize the possible etiologies of liver cirrhosis. (EPA 2)
3. Understand the utility of the serum ascites-albumin gradient (SAAG) to
differentiate causes of ascites. (EPA 3)
4. Outline the diagnosis of SBP. (EPA 1, 10)
Considerations
This 60-year-old man had been in good health until recently, when he noted
increasing abdominal swelling and discomfort. He has drunk significant amounts
of alcohol for an imprecise period of his life. Currently, he also has a low-grade fever
and mild abdominal tenderness; both signs suggest a possible infection. Bacterial
infection of the ascitic fluid must be considered and evaluated because untreated
cases have a high mortality. Although most patients with ascites and jaundice have
cirrhosis, other etiologies of the ascites must be considered, including malignancy.
Diagnostic paracentesis can be used to assess for infection as well as to seek an
etiology of the ascites.

APPROACH TO:
Liver Cirrhosis
DEFINITIONS
ASCITES: Abnormal accumulation (> 25 mL) of fluid within the peritoneal cavity.
CIRRHOSIS: Histologic diagnosis reflecting irreversible chronic hepatic injury,
which includes extensive fibrosis and formation of regenerative nodules.
PORTAL HYPERTENSION: Increased pressure gradient (> 5 mm Hg) in the
hepatic portal vein, usually resulting from resistance to portal flow and most com-
monly caused by cirrhosis.
SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS: Bacterial infection of ascitic
fluid without any primary intra-abdominal source of infection. Occurs in 10% to
20% of cirrhotic patients with ascites.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Cirrhosis represents the end stage of chronic hepatocellular injury that results
in fibrosis and architectural distortion with nodular regeneration. With ongoing
hepatocyte destruction, activated hepatic stellate cells promote collagen deposi-
tion, resulting in a hardened, nodular liver that shrinks in size. Alcoholic cirrhosis
is one of the most common forms of cirrhosis encountered in the United States.
Quantity and duration of alcohol intake, as well as gender, genetic predisposi-
tions, and concurrent chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, contribute to
the progression of alcoholic liver disease to cirrhosis. Other causes of cirrhosis
are listed in Table 24–1.
When cirrhosis is suspected, patients should have an ultrasound of the right
upper quadrant to assess for parenchymal changes, nodularity, hepatic cysts, and
biliary ductal dilation. Histologic evaluation of tissue via percutaneous liver biopsy
may be utilized for the pathologic diagnosis of cirrhosis and to differentiate the

etiology when it is not clear by history alone. This can be helpful to diagnose hemo-
chromatosis, Wilson disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. Increasingly, noninvasive
methods of diagnosis are being utilized, including elastography to assess the stiff-
ness of liver tissue, which correlates with hepatocellular fibrosis. Another nonin-
vasive test utilizes blood serum biomarker measurements to assign a fibrosis score
correlating with the severity of the liver fibrosis.
Clinical Presentation
Advanced liver disease will show mild elevations in AST (aspartate aminotrans-
ferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), with the AST:ALT ratio greater than
2 in alcoholics, although advanced cirrhosis may eventually show normal trans-
aminase levels due to loss of hepatocyte function. Total and direct bilirubin and
alkaline phosphatase may be elevated as well. Cirrhosis will also show elevated pro-
thrombin time, serum hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia usually with ascites, and
possibly electrolyte disturbances or impaired renal function. Patients also usually
will have low platelets and macrocytic anemia.
Cirrhotic patients are classified by the presence or absence of complications
(Table 24–2). Compensated cirrhosis refers to patients without clinical symptoms
beyond minor fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching. Decompensated cirrhosis refers
to the presence of cirrhosis with complications, such as jaundice, ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, SBP, and hepatorenal syndrome. Many of these
complications are driven by portal hypertension, which results from hepatocyte
fibrosis causing sinusoidal resistance to portal venous flow, as well as increased
splanchnic flow related to splanchnic vascular bed vasodilation.
Loss of functioning hepatic mass leads to jaundice as well as impaired syn-
thesis of albumin (leading to edema) and clotting factors (leading to coagulopa-
thy). Decreased liver production of steroid hormone-binding globulin leads to an
increase in unbound estrogen manifested by spider angiomata, palmar erythema,
and testicular atrophy and gynecomastia in men. Portal hypertension can also
result in hypersplenism and splenomegaly, resulting in platelet sequestration.
Ascites may result as a consequence of portal venous hypertension related to
cirrhosis. However, it may also be a result of exudative causes, such as infection (eg,
tuberculous peritonitis) or malignancy. It is important to distinguish the cause of
ascites in order to look for serious and/or reversible causes, such as malignancy, and
to guide therapy. Ascitic fluid is obtained by paracentesis and examined for protein,
albumin, cell count with differential, and culture. The first step in trying to deter-
mine the cause of ascites is to determine whether it is caused by portal hyperten-
sion or by an exudative process by calculating the SAAG (Table 24–3).
Treatment
The treatment of ascites that is secondary to liver cirrhosis usually consists of dietary
sodium restriction coupled with diuretics. Loop diuretics are often combined with
spironolactone to provide effective diuresis and to maintain normal potassium
levels.
Alcohol cessation is critical for those with alcoholic liver disease to prevent pro-
gression to advanced cirrhosis. Sustained abstinence after diagnosis of cirrhosis

should also be maintained to allow for possible modest reversal of fibrosis, which is
occasionally seen. Ultimately, liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment
for those with cirrhosis.
Patients being considered for transplant are stratified according to scoring systems
to estimate disease severity and survival. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score uses a patient’s laboratory values for serum bilirubin, serum creati-
nine, and the international normalized ratio (INR) for prothrombin time to pre-
dict survival. An older scoring system, the Child-Turcotte-Pugh system, also classifies
severity of disease, with class A having the best prognosis and class C the worst.
Prevention. Men who consume > 14 alcoholic drinks per week and women who
consume > 7 drinks per week should be counseled on alcohol use. A CAGE ques-
tionnaire (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener) should be utilized to assess for

readiness and willingness to adopt abstinence, with referral to alcohol abstinence

Complications
Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis. SBP is a relatively common complication of asci-
tes. It is thought to be caused by translocation of gut flora into the peritoneal fluid.
Symptoms include fever and abdominal pain, but often there is paucity of signs
and symptoms. Diagnosis is established by paracentesis and finding more than
250 neutrophils/mm3 OR by a positive culture. Culture of ascitic fluid often fails
to yield the organism (inserting fluid in a blood culture bottle raises the sensitivity
from 40% to 90%). However, when positive, fluid cultures usually reveal a single
organism, most often gram-negative enteric flora but occasionally enterococci or
pneumococci. This is in contrast to secondary peritonitis (eg, as a consequence of
intestinal perforation), which usually is polymicrobial. Empiric therapy includes
coverage for gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, such as intravenous ampi-
cillin/sulbactam, or a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime. Oral flu-
oroquinolones may also be used for uncomplicated SBP, but should be avoided in
patients who were taking quinolones for SBP prophylaxis, as their organisms may
be resistant. Patients who have had SBP in the past, or are considered high risk for
SBP, should be maintained on a prophylactic regimen with an oral fluoroquinolone.
Esophageal and Gastric Variceal Bleeding. Other complications of advanced cir-
rhosis with portal hypertension include esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding,
which can result in massive hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. Treatment
may include infusion of octreotide to cause splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduce
portal pressure. Esophageal varices can also be treated endoscopically with ligation
or banding to treat or prevent bleeding or with sclerotherapy for active bleeding. In
patients presenting with upper GI variceal bleed, the incidence of SBP is higher, and
these patients should be initiated on antibiotic prophylaxis. Surgical or transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may also be placed to decompress portal
pressure and reduce the bleeding risk as the patient awaits liver transplantation.

Case Files Internal Medicine,288,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 261
Hepatorenal Syndrome. Hepatorenal syndrome, which typically presents as pro-
gressive decline in renal function in patients with significant ascites, can also present
in advanced cirrhosis. The pathogenesis is poorly understood, though it is thought
to be related to multifactorial renal vasoconstriction. Treatment is difficult, and
prognosis is often poor unless patients proceed for liver transplantation.
Hepatic Encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by mental sta-
tus changes, asterixis, and elevated ammonia levels related to loss of hepatic func-
tion. It may be precipitated by numerous factors, including infection such as SBP,
electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia), increased dietary protein load, and GI
bleeding; it can also occur just after a TIPS procedure. Diagnosis is a clinical one
based on history and physical examination and by excluding other causes of confu-
sion. Ammonia levels are variable in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and
should not be relied on to make the diagnosis. Treatment is aimed at correcting
underlying causes, as well as administration of lactulose, a nonabsorbable disaccha-
ride that causes colonic acidification and elimination of nitrogenous waste. Other
cathartic agents are also effective. Poorly absorbed antibiotics such as neomycin
and rifaximin are used as adjuncts in refractory cases of hepatic encephalopathy.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
24.1 A 54-year-old man with an unknown medical history is brought to the emer-
gency department by his brother with reports that the patient has been
feeling dizzy and lightheaded. His brother states that the patient has been
depressed since his divorce and has been binge drinking nearly daily for the
last 6 months. Last night, he came home after drinking heavily and vomited
multiple times, with some blood-tinged vomit. He does not take any medi-
cations and has no known medical problems. On examination, the patient
is alert but tired-appearing. Blood pressure is 94/60 mm Hg, heart rate is
126 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min, and temperature
is 99.3 °F. Lungs are clear to auscultation, and he is tachycardic with regular
rhythm. His abdomen is distended, though soft, with quiet bowel sounds and
positive shifting dullness to percussion. While being examined, the patient
has a large bowel movement of black stool. Which of the following is the next
best step?
A. Administer intravenous fluids.
B. Await results of hemoglobin and hematocrit.
C. Call surgery for an emergency laparotomy.
D. Give him an antiemetic for his nausea.
E. Start a proton pump inhibitor.

24.2 A 55-year-old woman with a history of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis
was admitted to the hospital 5 days ago with melena. An esophagogastroduo-
denoscopy (EGD) was performed, and bleeding varices were banded. The
patient was started on antibiotics with ceftriaxone to prevent SBP in the set-
ting of bleeding. Despite that fact, she developed SBP on day 3. On daily labs,
her creatinine has been steadily increasing and now is at 3.1 mg/dL (1.5 on
the day of admission). Despite treatment with antibiotics, holding diuretics on
the day of admission, and administration of fluids and albumin, her kidney
function continues to worsen. Her vital signs are normal. Physical examina-
tion shows significant ascites. Urine analysis is normal without hematuria
or proteinuria. Urine Na is low (< 10 mEq/L). A renal ultrasound does not
show any evidence of obstruction to urine flow. Which of the following is the
definitive treatment for her condition?
A. Changing antibiotics from ceftriaxone to vancomycin and cefepime
B. Performing a TIPS procedure
C. Starting the patient on dialysis
D. Liver transplantation
24.3 A 49-year-old woman with a history of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus
presents to the outpatient clinic with 2 to 3 months of fatigue, abdominal
distention, and bilateral edema of the legs. On examination, her vital signs
are normal and ascites is present, as is bilateral pitting edema of the legs. She
is jaundiced and has several spider angiomas on her trunk. Her laboratory
work shows mild macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and low albumin.
Her liver enzymes are normal. Her liver ultrasound shows findings sugges-
tive of fatty liver. The patient denies ever drinking alcohol. Workup of viral
hepatitis is negative. What would be the best test to establish the presence of
liver cirrhosis and its etiology?
A. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver
B. Measurement of alpha-fetoprotein
C. Liver biopsy
D. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis-liver protocol
ANSWERS
24.1 A. The patient likely has an upper GI bleed from ruptured esophageal varices,
related to undiagnosed alcoholic cirrhosis, based on his binge drinking his-
tory and notable ascites on examination. He is tachycardic and hypotensive,
and the first step should be volume resuscitation. Awaiting laboratory results
before acting would not be appropriate (answer B). He will benefit from ini-
tiation of octreotide, a somatostatin analog to decrease portal pressures, fol-
lowed by early upper endoscopy. A proton pump inhibitor will not be helpful
for bleeding varices (answer E). Antiemetics may improve his nausea, but it is
not the most important first step (answer D). A laparotomy is not indicated
for melena related to bleeding varices (answer C).
25_Toy-IM_Case24_p255-264.indd 262 25/08/20 9:30 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,290,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 263
24.2 D. The patient has likely hepatorenal syndrome, and liver transplantation
is the definitive treatment for this. While SBP is a known trigger for hepa-
torenal syndrome, antibiotics alone are unlikely to improve renal function
(answer A). TIPS (answer B) will reduce portal hypertension, and dialysis
(answer C) can be used to treat complications of renal failure in the setting of
hepatorenal syndrome; however, neither is a definitive treatment. They can
be implemented while the patient is waiting for liver transplantation.
24.3 C. The presence of diabetes mellitus and the absence of an obvious explana-
tion for this patient’s liver dysfunction suggest liver disease resulting from
fatty deposition. A liver biopsy differentiates alcoholic from nonalcoholic
fatty liver, and the innocuous fatty liver from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(which frequently progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma).
Despite its diagnostic value, a liver biopsy seldom alters therapeutic options.
Imaging (answers A and D) and alpha-fetoprotein (answer B) have no specific
etiologic diagnostic value.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Alcoholic cirrhosis is one of the most common forms of cirrhosis encoun-
»
tered in the United States, with other notable causes including viral hep-
atitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Cirrhotic patients are classified by the presence or absence of complica-
»
tions associated with their liver dysfunction, most of which are driven by
portal hypertension.
An SAAG greater than 1.1 g/dL suggests the ascites is caused by portal
»
hypertension, as seen in cirrhosis.
All patients with ascites presenting to the hospital should have diagnos-
»
tic paracentesis to rule out SBP, a complication of ascites and cirrhosis
carrying a high mortality.
SBP is characterized by the presence of greater than 250 polymorphonu-
»
clear cells/mm3 in the ascitic fluid, occasionally accompanied by positive
monomicrobial culture.
TIPS may be placed to decompress portal pressure to prevent esopha-
»
geal variceal bleeding, but this may trigger hepatic encephalopathy.
Hepatic transplant is the only cure for advanced liver cirrhosis.
»
All patients who drink alcohol should be screened for alcohol use disor-
»
der with a CAGE questionnaire and counseled on abstinence to prevent
development of alcoholic cirrhosis.

A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of
24 hours of severe, steady epigastric abdominal pain radiating to her back with
several episodes of nausea and vomiting. She has experienced similar painful
episodes in the past, usually in the evening following heavy meals, but the prior
episodes always resolved spontaneously within an hour or two. This time the pain
did not improve, so she sought medical attention. She has no medical history
and takes no medications. She is married, has three children, and does not drink
alcohol or smoke cigarettes.
On examination, she is afebrile with tachycardia of 104 beats per minute
(bpm), a blood pressure of 115/74 mm Hg, and shallow respirations at a rate of
22 breaths/min. She is moving uncomfortably on the stretcher. Her skin is warm
and diaphoretic, and she has scleral icterus. Her abdomen is soft, mildly distended
with marked right upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric tenderness to palpation,
hypoactive bowel sounds, and no palpable masses or organomegaly. Her stool is
negative for occult blood. Laboratory studies are significant for an elevated total
bilirubin (9.2 g/dL) with a direct fraction of 4.8 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 285 IU/L,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 78 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 92 IU/L,
and elevated serum lipase level. Her leukocyte count is 16,500/mm3 with 82%

Considerations
This 42-year-old woman complained of intermittent episodes of short duration
of mild RUQ abdominal pain with heavy meals in the past. This is very consistent
with biliary colic. However, this episode is different in severity and location of pain
(now radiating straight to her back and accompanied by nausea and vomiting).
The elevated lipase level confirms the clinical impression of acute pancreatitis likely
caused by a stone in the common bile duct. Biliary obstruction is suggested by the
elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. She is moderately ill but is hemo-
dynamically stable and has only one prognostic feature to predict mortality.

Acute Pancreatitis and Cholelithiasis
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE PANCREATITIS: An inflammatory process in which pancreatic enzymes
are activated and cause autodigestion of the pancreas.
PANCREATIC PSEUDOCYST: Fluid collection within the pancreas not lined by
epithelial cells, appearing several days after some cases of acute pancreatitis and
often associated with chronic pancreatitis.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO ACUTE PANCREATITIS
Pathophysiology
Acute pancreatitis can be caused by many conditions, although gallstones and alco-
hol are implicated in up to two-thirds of cases. The passage of gallstones into the
common bile duct is the most common cause and is responsible for approximately
40% to 70% of cases. Alcohol use is the next most common cause (25%-35% of
cases in the United States), with episodes often precipitated by binge drinking.
Hypertriglyceridemia is another common cause (1%-14% of cases) and occurs
when serum triglyceride levels are more than 1000 mg/dL, as is seen in patients
with familial dyslipidemias or diabetes (etiologies are given in Table 25–2). Acute
pancreatitis can also be induced by ERCP, occurring after 5% to 10% of such pro-
cedures. Less common etiologies include genetic predisposition, medication, infec-
tions, hypercalcemia, toxins, vascular disease, or anatomic/physiologic anomalies
of the pancreas. When patients appear to have “idiopathic” pancreatitis, that is,
no gallstones are seen on ultrasonography and no other predisposing factor can be

found, biliary tract disease is still the most likely cause, either biliary sludge (micro-
lithiasis) or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
Epigastric pain and/or RUQ pain can have a variety of etiologies. Other diag-
noses that may be considered during the workup of acute pancreatitis include pep-
tic ulcer disease, bowel perforation, intestinal obstruction, mesenteric ischemia,
diabetic ketoacidosis, or hepatitis. Many additional diagnoses that should be con-
sidered are directly related to gallstone production, including biliary colic, choledo-
cholithiasis, cholangitis, and cholecystitis.
Clinical Presentation
Abdominal pain is the cardinal symptom of pancreatitis and often is severe, typically
in the upper abdomen with radiation to the back. The pain is often relieved by sitting
up and leaning forward and is exacerbated by food. Patients commonly experience
nausea and vomiting that is precipitated by oral intake. They may have low-grade
fever (if temperature is > 101 °F, one should suspect infection) and are often volume
depleted because of the vomiting and inability to tolerate oral intake. The inflam-
matory process may cause third spacing, with sequestration of large volumes of
fluid in the peritoneal cavity additionally leading to intravascular depletion. Hem-
orrhagic pancreatitis with blood tracking along fascial planes would be suspected
if periumbilical ecchymosis (Cullen sign) or flank ecchymosis (Grey Turner sign) is
present.
During the physical examination, those with acute pancreatitis may appear
noticeably uncomfortable. On initial and repeat examinations, it is important to
take note of the vitals since fever, hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea may alter
subsequent management and diagnosis. Common findings on examination include
epigastric pain with or without pain in the RUQ; pain can vary greatly in severity.
Jaundice, abdominal distention, and presence or absence of bowel sounds are also
important to note.
The common test used to diagnose pancreatitis is an elevated serum lipase level.
It is more specific than serum amylase to support the diagnosis of acute pancreati-
tis. Levels remain elevated in the bloodstream longer than amylase. Serum amylase
is not specific to the pancreas, however, and can be elevated as a consequence of
many other abdominal processes, such as gastrointestinal ischemia with infarction
26_Toy-IM_Case25_p265-274.indd 268 25/08/20 9:31 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,296,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 269
or perforation; even just the vomiting associated with pancreatitis can cause elevated
amylase of salivary origin. It is released from the inflamed pancreas within hours
of the attack and remains elevated for 3 to 4 days. When the diagnosis is uncertain
or when complications of pancreatitis are suspected, computed tomographic (CT)
imaging of the abdomen is highly sensitive for showing the inflammatory changes in
patients with moderate-to-severe pancreatitis.
Treatment
Treatment is mainly supportive and includes “pancreatic rest,” that is, withholding
food or liquids by mouth until symptoms subside, and adequate narcotic analgesia.
Intravenous fluids are necessary for maintenance and to replace any deficits. In
patients with severe pancreatitis who sequester large volumes of fluid in their abdo-
men as pancreatic ascites, considerable amounts of parenteral fluid replacement
are necessary to maintain intravascular volume. ERCP with papillotomy to remove
bile duct stones may lessen the severity of gallstone pancreatitis and is usually done
within 24 to 48 hours. When pain has largely subsided and the patient has bowel
sounds, oral clear liquids can be started and the diet advanced as tolerated.
Most patients with acute pancreatitis will recover spontaneously and have a
relatively uncomplicated course. Several scoring systems have been developed in an
attempt to identify the 15% to 25% of patients who will have a more complicated
course, including the Bedside Index for Severity of Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP)
score and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)
score. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis may require management in a moni-
tored or intensive care unit. The most common cause of early death in patients with
pancreatitis is hypovolemic shock, which is multifactorial: third spacing and seques-
tration of large fluid volumes in the abdomen, as well as increased capillary perme-
ability. Others develop pulmonary edema, which may be noncardiogenic due to
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or cardiogenic as a consequence of
myocardial dysfunction.
Complications
Pancreatic complications include a phlegmon, which is a solid mass of inflamed
pancreas, often with patchy areas of necrosis. Sometimes, extensive areas of pancre-
atic necrosis develop within a phlegmon. Either necrosis or a phlegmon can become
secondarily infected, resulting in pancreatic abscess. Abscesses typically develop
2 to 3 weeks after the onset of illness and should be suspected if there is fever or
leukocytosis. If pancreatic abscesses are not drained, mortality approaches 100%.
Pancreatic necrosis and abscess are the leading causes of death in patients after the
first week of illness. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of inflammatory fluid
and pancreatic secretions; unlike true cysts, these do not have an epithelial lining.
Most pancreatic pseudocysts resolve spontaneously within 6 weeks, especially if
they are smaller than 6 cm. However, if they are causing pain, are large or expand-
ing, or become infected, they usually require drainage. Any of these local complica-
tions of pancreatitis should be suspected if persistent pain, fever, abdominal mass,
or persistent hyperamylasemia occurs.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO CHOLELTHIASIS
Pathophysiology
Gallstones usually form as a consequence of precipitation of cholesterol microcrys-
tals in bile. They are very common, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients older than
65 years. Patients are often asymptomatic. When discovered incidentally, they can
be followed without intervention, as only 10% of patients will develop any symp-
toms related to their stones within 10 years. When patients do develop symptoms
because of a stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann pouch, the typical attack of
biliary colic is sudden in onset, often precipitated by a large or fatty meal, with
severe steady pain in the RUQ or epigastrium, lasting between 1 and 4 hours. They
may have mild elevations of the alkaline phosphatase level and slight hyperbiliru-
binemia, but elevations of the bilirubin level over 3 g/dL suggest a common duct
stone. The first diagnostic test in a patient with suspected gallstones usually is an
ultrasonogram. The test is noninvasive and very sensitive for detecting stones in the
gallbladder as well as intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation.
Treatment
Patients with asymptomatic gallstones do not require treatment; they can be
observed and treated if symptoms develop. Cholecystectomy is performed for
patients with symptoms of biliary colic or for those with complications.
One of the most common complications of gallstones is acute cholecystitis, which
occurs when a stone becomes impacted in the cystic duct, and edema and inflam-
mation develop behind the obstruction. This is apparent ultrasonographically as
gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid; it is characterized clinically as
a persistent RUQ abdominal pain, with fever and leukocytosis. Cultures of bile in
the gallbladder often yield enteric flora such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella. If the
diagnosis is in question, nuclear scintigraphy with a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid
(HIDA) scan may be performed. The positive test shows visualization of the liver
by the isotope, but nonvisualization of the gallbladder may indicate an obstructed
cystic duct. Treatment of acute cholecystitis usually involves making the patient
nil per os (NPO; nothing by mouth), intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and early
cholecystectomy within 48 to 72 hours.
Another complication of gallstones is cholangitis, which occurs when there is
intermittent obstruction of the common bile duct, allowing reflux of bacteria up
the biliary tree, followed by development of purulent infection behind the obstruc-
tion. If the patient is septic, the condition requires urgent decompression of the
biliary tree, either surgically or by ERCP, to remove the stones endoscopically after
performing a papillotomy, which allows the other stones to pass.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
25.1 A 43-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute pan-
creatitis. His family shares that he is a heavy user of alcohol. He is given
intravenous hydration and is placed NPO. Which of the following findings is
the highest predictor of mortality?
A. His age
B. Initial serum glucose level of 60 mg/dL
C. BUN of 18 mg/dL
D. Disorientation, with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10
E. Amylase level of 1000 IU/L
25.2 A 37-year-old woman was being followed by her primary provider for symp-
tomatic gallstones, which were confirmed on ultrasonography. She was
placed on a low-fat diet and was doing well for the past 3 months. However,
today, she presents to the emergency center with severe RUQ pain and
nausea. On examination, her temperature is 102.3 °F, heart rate 100 bpm,
and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. Her abdominal examination reveals
marked RUQ tenderness and guarding. There is no rebound tenderness.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Acute cholangitis
B. Acute cholecystitis
C. Acute pancreatitis
D. Acute perforation of the gallbladder
25.3 A 45-year-old man was admitted for acute pancreatitis, thought to be a result
of blunt abdominal trauma. After 3 months, he still has epigastric pain but is
able to eat solid food. His amylase level is elevated at 260 IU/L. Which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Recurrent pancreatitis
B. Diverticulitis
C. Peptic ulcer disease
D. Pancreatic pseudocyst
ANSWERS
25.1 D. Impaired mental status is a poor prognostic sign. Other findings associ-
ated with higher mortality include a BUN > 25 mg/dL (not 18 mg/dL, as in
answer C), presence of SIRS, age over 60 (not 43 years of age, as in answer A),
and presence of a pleural effusion. Notably, the amylase level (answer E)
does not correlate with the severity of the disease. Thus, although the serum
amylase level or lipase level helps to make a diagnosis of pancreatitis, it is
the presence of other findings that dictates prognosis. Hyperglycemia with a
26_Toy-IM_Case25_p265-274.indd 271 25/08/20 9:31 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,299,"272 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
serum glucose exceeding 200 mg/dL indicates significant pancreatic dysfunc-
tion and is a poor prognostic factor; this patient’s glucose level of 60 mg/dL
(answer B) is therefore not a significant prognostic indicator.
25.2 B. Acute cholecystitis is one of the most common complications of gall-
stones. This patient with fever, RUQ pain, and a history of gallstones likely
has acute cholecystitis. Acute cholangitis (answer A) usually presents with
Charcot triad (RUQ pain, jaundice, and fever/chills) due to an ascend-
ing infection proximal to an obstructed bile duct. There is no description
of icterus. Acute pancreatitis (answer C) is a complication of gallstones,
but affected patients typically present with midline epigastric pain radiat-
ing to the back. Acute perforation of the gallbladder (answer D) is a rare
complication of cholecystitis that is life threatening; associated findings
include high fever, nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal tenderness with
rebound. Treatment is generally surgical, and early diagnosis is important
to reduce mortality.
25.3 D. A pancreatic pseudocyst has a clinical presentation of abdominal pain and
mass and persistent hyperamylasemia in a patient with prior pancreatitis.
The fact that the patient’s pain has largely abated and he is able to eat food
speaks against recurrent pancreatitis (answer A). Acute diverticulitis
(answer B) usually presents with the acute onset of left lower quadrant
abdominal tenderness, fever, and nausea. Peptic ulcer disease (answer C)
presents with burning epigastric pain that radiates to the back.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The three most common causes of acute pancreatitis in the United States
»
are gallstones, alcohol consumption, and hypertriglyceridemia.
Acute pancreatitis usually is managed with pancreatic rest, intravenous

hydration, and analgesia, often narcotics.
Pancreatic complications (phlegmon, necrosis, abscess, pseudocyst)

ANSWERS TO CASE 26:
Acute Hepatitis
Summary: A 28-year-old man presents with
No past medical history

Five days of nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, fever, and myalgias

Twelve different lifetime sexual partners

Recent history of taking large amounts of acetaminophen

Icteric appearance with a low-grade fever and tender hepatomegaly

Laboratory results consistent with severe hepatocellular injury

Most likely diagnosis: Acute hepatitis, either viral infection or toxic injury, possibly
exacerbated by acetaminophen use due to the patient’s young age, sexual history,
lack of medication/supplement use, and pattern of liver study results.
Most important immediate diagnostic test: Acetaminophen level, as acetaminophen
toxicity may greatly exacerbate liver injury but is treatable.
Important management consideration: If fulminant liver failure is suspected, the
patient should be transferred to a liver transplant center to be evaluated, as fulmi-
nant liver failure may be rapidly fatal. Evaluate for encephalopathy in conjunction
with hepatic synthetic dysfunction.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the use of viral serologic studies for diagnosing hepatitis A, B, and
C infections. (EPA 3)
2. Recognize the prognosis for acute viral hepatitis and recognize fulminant
hepatic failure. (EPA 1, 12)
3. List measures to prevent hepatitis A and B infections. (EPA 12)
4. Understand the use of the acetaminophen nomogram and the treatment of
acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. (EPA 3, 4)
Considerations
This patient has an acute onset of hepatic injury and systemic symptoms that pre-
date his acetaminophen use. The markedly elevated hepatic transaminases and bili-
rubin levels are consistent with viral hepatitis or toxic injury. This patient denied
intravenous drug use, which would be a risk factor for hepatitis B and C infections.
27_Toy-IM_Case26_p275-286.indd 276 02/09/20 6:45 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,304,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 277
However, his sexual history does place him at higher risk for these infections.
The degree and pattern of transaminase ALT and AST elevation provide
clues to help differentiate possible etiologies. Transaminase levels more than
1000 IU/L are seen in conditions that produce extensive hepatic necrosis, such
as toxic injury, viral hepatitis, and ischemia (“shock liver”). Meanwhile, patients
with alcoholic hepatitis almost always have levels less than 500 IU/L and often
have an AST/ALT ratio of 2:1. In this case, it is important to consider the pos-
sibility of acetaminophen toxicity, both because the condition can produce fatal
liver failure and because an effective antidote is available. By obtaining a serum
acetaminophen level and knowing the time of his last ingestion, the provider
can plot the data on a nomogram (Figure 26–1) to help predict acetaminophen-
related liver damage and the possible need for N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which
is the antidote.

APPROACH TO:
Viral and Acetaminophen Hepatitis
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE HEPATITIS: Inflammation of the liver that may be caused by infection,
ischemia, autoimmune state, or toxic exposure for a duration of less than 26 weeks.
At least six viruses that cause hepatitis have been identified, referred to as hepatitis
A, B, C, D, E, and G. Hepatitis A, C, D, E, and G are RNA viruses, while hepatitis
B is a DNA virus.
CHRONIC HEPATITIS: A syndrome that is defined clinically by evidence of liver
disease with inflammation and necrosis for at least 26 weeks, most commonly with
hepatitis B, C, and D infections.
CIRRHOSIS: Diffuse damage to hepatocytes, which show evidence of chronic
inflammation with fibrosis and loss of hepatocyte function.
FULMINANT HEPATIC FAILURE: A rare, but devastating, syndrome that
rapidly progresses within 8 weeks of symptom onset. Normal hepatic function is
arrested, and clinical manifestations include markedly elevated serum transami-
nases, jaundice, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO VIRAL HEPATITIS
Epidemiology
Most cases of acute hepatitis are caused by infection with one of the five viruses:
hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. These viruses produce virtually indistinguishable clinical
syndromes, although it is unusual to observe acute hepatitis C. Affected individuals
often complain of a prodrome of nonspecific constitutional symptoms, including
fever, nausea, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, and sometimes pharyngitis
and coryza, which is then followed by the onset of jaundice caused by hyperbili-
rubinemia and dark urine caused by hyperbilirubinuria. The liver may be enlarged
(hepatomegaly) and tender. The clinical course and prognosis vary based on the
type of virus causing the hepatitis.
The differential diagnosis for acute hepatitis includes viral, toxic, ischemic,
or autoimmune injury. Viral hepatitis can originate from infection by the sev-
eral viruses described in the material that follows; less commonly, it be caused by
Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus,
and adenovirus, among others. Toxic injury may be the result of medications (ie,
acetaminophen, statins, phenytoin, ketoconazole), alcohol, supplements (ie, black
cohosh, kava), or mushroom poisoning (ie, Amanita phalloides). Ischemic injury
may occur during episodes of severe, acute hypoperfusion. Budd-Chiari and veno-
occlusive disease may also lead to acute hepatitis. Additional causes include Wilson
disease, leptospirosis, malignant infiltration, or heatstroke.

Case Files Internal Medicine,306,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 279
Pathophysiology
Hepatitis A and E both are very contagious and transmitted either by the fecal-
oral route, usually through contaminated food or water where sanitation is poor,
or from person to person, such as in day care settings by children. Hepatitis A
is found worldwide and is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in the
United States. Hepatitis E is much less common and is found in Asia, Africa,
Central America, and the Caribbean. Both hepatitis A and E infections usually
lead to self-limited illnesses and generally resolve within weeks. Almost all patients
with hepatitis A recover completely and have no long-term complications. Less
than 1% of those infected with hepatitis A develop fulminant liver disease resulting
in hepatic failure, and those patients are generally > 50 years old and have some
underlying chronic liver disease. Most patients with hepatitis E also have uncompli-
cated courses, but some patients, particularly pregnant women, have been reported
to develop severe hepatic necrosis and fatal liver failure.
Hepatitis B is the second most common type of viral hepatitis in the
United States and is usually sexually transmitted. It also may be acquired paren-
terally, such as by intravenous drug use, or during birth from chronically infected
mothers. The outcome depends on the age at which the infection was acquired.
Up to 90% of infected newborns develop chronic hepatitis B infection, which
places the affected infant at significant risk of hepatocellular carcinoma later in
adulthood. For individuals infected later in life, approximately 95% of patients
will recover completely without sequelae. Between 5% and 10% of patients will
develop chronic hepatitis, which may progress to cirrhosis. A chronic carrier state
may be seen in which the virus continues to replicate, but it does not cause irre-
versible hepatic damage in the host.
Hepatitis C is transmitted parenterally by blood transfusions or intravenous drug
use and less commonly by sexual contact. The mode of transmission is unknown
in approximately 40% of cases. It is uncommonly diagnosed as a cause of acute
hepatitis, often producing subclinical infection, but is frequently diagnosed later
as a cause of chronic hepatitis with or without the presence of liver cirrhosis. The
majority of hepatitis C infection leads to chronic hepatitis, but the development
of newer medications can lead to the cure of many patients; for this reason, most
preventive guidelines recommend screening for hepatitis C infection at least once
during adulthood and more often in high-risk individuals.
Hepatitis D is a defective RNA virus that requires the presence of the hepatitis
B virus to replicate. It can be acquired as a coinfection simultaneously with acute
hepatitis B or as a later superinfection in a person with a chronic hepatitis B infec-
tion. Patients afflicted with chronic hepatitis B virus who then become infected
with hepatitis D may suffer clinical deterioration; in 10% to 20% of these cases,
individuals develop severe fatal hepatic failure.
Clinical Presentation
Since there are many causes of acute hepatitis, a good history is vital. The history
should include targeted questions about the patient’s drug use, sexual contacts,
and travel history. Additional questions should investigate possible exposures
27_Toy-IM_Case26_p275-286.indd 279 02/09/20 6:45 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,307,"280 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
to toxins and supplements. Timing of symptoms may also help elucidate an
etiology.
Examination findings may include jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness,
ascites, and signs of intravascular depletion, such as orthostatic vitals. It is important
to perform a complete neurologic examination on the patient to assess for encepha-
lopathy. If encephalopathy is present, then it should be graded I-IV. Grade I may be
evident by confusion, abnormal behavior, changes in sleeping patterns, or slurred
speech. This may be difficult to distinguish from grade II, which has progressive
lethargy. Profound confusion, incoherent speech, and increased sleeping may be
signs of grade III encephalopathy, while grade IV is hallmarked by coma. Findings
on physical examination may not help distinguish the etiology of acute hepatic
failure, and further studies are usually needed.
Serologic studies are generally used to establish a diagnosis. Anti-hepatitis A
immunoglobulin M (IgM) establishes an acute hepatitis A infection. Anti-hepatitis C
antibody is present in acute hepatitis C, but the test result may be negative for
several weeks. The hepatitis C RNA assay, which becomes positive earlier in the
disease course, often aids in the diagnosis. Acute hepatitis B infection is diagnosed
by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the clinical context of
elevated serum transaminase levels and jaundice. HBsAg later disappears when the
antibody (anti-HBs) is produced (Figure 26–2). There is often an interval of a few
weeks between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBsAb.
This period is referred to as the “window period.” During this interval, the presence
of anti-hepatitis B core antigen IgM (anti–HBc IgM) is indicative of an acute hepa-
titis B infection. A positive hepatitis B precore antigen (HBeAg) represents a high
level of viral replication and high infectivity. It is almost always present during acute
infection, but its persistence after 6 weeks of illness is a sign of chronic infection

and high infectivity. Persistence of HBsAg or HBeAg is a marker for chronic hepa-
titis or a chronic carrier state; elevated versus normal serum transaminase levels
distinguish between these two entities, respectively. Patients who have been vacci-
nated against hepatitis B will have a positive HBsAb but no other positive serology.
Treatment and Complications
Fortunately, in most cases of acute viral hepatitis, patients recover completely, so
the treatment is generally supportive. However, fulminant hepatic failure due to
massive hepatic necrosis may progress over a period of weeks and is usually caused
by infections from the hepatitis B and D viruses or from toxins. Toxin- or drug-
induced liver injury is the most common cause of acute liver failure and can be a result
of direct toxic effects of substances on the liver parenchyma (acetaminophen,
A. phalloides) or idiosyncratic reactions of medications (halothane, isoniazid, phe-
nytoin). Direct toxic effects are predictable and dose dependent, but idiosyncratic
reactions are not.
Acute hepatic failure is characterized by rapid progression of encephalopathy
from confusion or somnolence to coma. Patients also have markedly high serum
aminotransferase levels, worsening coagulopathy, rising bilirubin levels, ascites and
peripheral edema, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and lactic acidosis. Fulminant
hepatic failure carries a poor prognosis (the mortality for comatose patients is
80%) and often is fatal without an emergent liver transplant.
Prevention. The efficacy of the hepatitis A vaccine (available in two doses given
6 months apart) exceeds 90%. It is indicated for individuals planning to travel
to endemic areas, along with those with chronic hepatitis B or C. Postexposure
prophylaxis with hepatitis A immunoglobulin, along with the first injection of
the vaccine, should be given to household and intimate contacts within 2 weeks
of exposure. The hepatitis B vaccine (given in three doses over 6 months) provides
effective immunity in more than 90% of patients. It is recommended for health
care workers, those with chronic hepatitis C, and all infants in the United States.
Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) is given after exposure, such as to health care
providers after a needlestick injury from an infected patient, or to newborns of
infected mothers. The first inoculation of the vaccine is usually given concurrently.
There is no immunization and no proven postexposure prophylaxis for persons
exposed to hepatitis C. Interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogs, such as entecavir,
tenofovir, or lamivudine, are used to treat patients with chronic hepatitis B. Treat-
ment for chronic hepatitis C has undergone major advancement with utilization
of direct acting antivirals (DAAs), sometimes in combination with ribavirin or
interferon, allowing for high rates of curative treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
Examples of DAA selections include sofosbuvir, a nucleoside analog of the
hepatitis C virus, and simeprevir, a protease inhibitor specific to proteins on
the hepatitis C virus. Regimens for treatment are based on hepatitis C genotyping,
with genotype I being the most common, along with history of prior treatment
failure and comorbidities.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO ACETAMINOPHEN HEPATITIS
Pathophysiology
Acetaminophen poisoning is among the most common types of medication-
induced toxicity and death. Acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular injury may
result after a single, large ingestion, as in a suicide attempt, or by chronic use of
over-the-counter acetaminophen-containing preparations for treatment of pain
or fever. Hepatic toxicity most often occurs after an acute ingestion of 10 g or
more, but lower doses (4 g in 24 hours) may cause injury to patients with pre-
existing liver disease, particularly in those who abuse alcohol. Acetaminophen is
metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which produces
a toxic metabolite. This metabolite is detoxified by binding to glutathione. Risk of
hepatic injury is greater when P450 activity is augmented by drugs such as ethanol
or phenobarbital or when less glutathione is available, as in alcoholism, malnutri-
tion, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Acetaminophen levels are
measured between 4 and 24 hours after an acute ingestion and plotted on a nomo-
gram to predict possible hepatotoxicity and determine if treatment is necessary.
Sometimes, empiric therapy is started even before laboratory results return.
Treatment
Treatment of the acetaminophen toxicity is dependent on time of presentation.
Patients who present promptly after ingestion of large amounts of acetamino-
phen may benefit from gastric decontamination with charcoal if no additional
contraindications exist. Gastric decontamination is most beneficial if performed
within the first 4 hours after ingestion. If acetaminophen levels are above the level
that predisposes to hepatic injury or if there is a significant risk of hepatotoxicity,
administration of NAC is indicated. NAC functions as an antidote to acetamino-
phen toxicity by providing cysteine to replenish glutathione stores. Ideally, NAC
should be started prior to evidence of liver injury and within the first 10 hours of
ingestion in attempt to prevent liver damage; it is continued for 72 hours. Mean-
while, the patient should not receive any medications that are known to be hepa-
totoxic. It is equally important to ensure that patients are receiving adequate
supportive therapy based on the severity of disease presentation. Patients may
require fluid resuscitation, airway support, vasopressors, dialysis, and/or man-
agement of cerebral edema.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
26.1 A 25-year-old medical student is stuck with a hollow needle during a pro-
cedure performed on a patient known to have hepatitis B and C viral infec-
tions, but who is HIV negative. The student’s baseline laboratory studies
include serology: HBsAg negative, anti-HBsAb positive, and anti-HBc IgG
negative. Which of the following regarding this medical student’s hepatitis
status is true?
A. Prior vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine
B. Acute infection with hepatitis B virus
C. Prior infection with hepatitis B virus
D. The student was vaccinated for hepatitis B but is not immune
26.2 What postexposure prophylaxis (if any) should the student described in
Question 26.1 receive?
A. HBIg
B. Oral tenofovir
C. Immunoglobulin
D. Reassurance
26.3 In a suicide attempt, an 18-year-old woman took 4 g of acetaminophen,
approximately 8 hours previously. On examination, she is drowsy but oriented
and answers questions appropriately. Her blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg
and heart rate is 90 bpm. She is anicteric. Her heart, lung, and abdominal
examinations are normal. Her acetaminophen level is 30 mcg/mL. Which of
the following is the best next step to be performed for this patient?
A. Immediately start NAC
B. Observation
C. Alkalinize the urine
D. Administer intravenous activated charcoal
ANSWERS
26.1 A. This student’s serology is most consistent with vaccination and not prior
infection. Like all health care workers, the student should have been vacci-
nated against the hepatitis B virus, which induces anti-HBs IgG antibody,
and is thought to be protective. Not all people receiving the vaccine develop
an adequate antibody titer; if none were detected, it would indicate the
need for revaccination (answer D). Patients with prior hepatitis B infection
(answer C) also have anti-HBsAb but will additionally have anti-HBc IgG.
Acute infection (answer B) would be established by the presence of either
HBsAg or anti-HBc IgM.
27_Toy-IM_Case26_p275-286.indd 283 02/09/20 6:45 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,311,"284 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
26.2 D. No postexposure prophylaxis is definitively indicated. The student has
detectable protective antibody levels against the hepatitis B virus, and if
the levels are judged to be adequate, the student is protected against infec-
tion. Thus, the key point in this question is that the presence of anti-HBsAg
antibody is protective. Oral tenofovir (answer B) is a treatment for chronic
hepatitis B infection and is part of an antiretroviral prophylaxis if the patient
were HIV positive. There is no effective prophylaxis for hepatitis C expo-
sure. Seroconversion against this virus needs to be retested at a later time.
Thus, passive immunization with HBIg (answer A) is not needed. Answer C
(immunoglobulin) is indicated for hepatitis A exposure but not hepatitis B.
26.3 B. The serum acetaminophen level of 30 mcg/mL, with last ingestion 8 hours
previously, is plotted on the nomogram and falls below the “danger zone” of
possible hepatic injury. Thus, this patient should be observed. Sometimes,
patients will take more than one medication, and serum and/or urine drug
testing may be worthwhile. Gastrointestinal activated charcoal, not intrave-
nous charcoal (answer D), is used for other ingestions. Initiation of NAC
(answer A) is recommended when the normogram suggests possible hepatic
injury. Alkalinization (answer C) of the urine is helpful to enhance excretion
of acidic toxins such as aspirin but does not have a role in acetaminophen
toxicity.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The most common cause of acute hepatic failure is toxin or drug injury,
»
which may be due to direct toxic effects or an idiosyncratic reaction.
The likelihood of toxic acetaminophen injury and the need for treatment

can be predicted from a nomogram based on serum level and the time
since last ingestion.
The majority of adults with acute hepatitis B infection recover completely.
»
However, 5% to 10% develop chronic hepatitis.
Vaccination for hepatitis B should produce measurable HBsAb. Presence

of anti-HBc IgG indicates evidence of prior infection. Anti-HBc IgM can be
positive during the “window period” of acute infection.
Prevention of hepatitis B viral infection hinges on long-term immu-

nity with a highly effective recombinant vaccine or postexposure pro-
phylaxis with HBIg. There is no vaccine or postexposure prophylaxis
for hepatitis C.

A 57-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of malaise for several weeks.
He says that he has not been feeling well for some time, with fatigue, depressed
mood, loss of appetite, and a 20-lb unintentional weight loss. In addition, he has
been bothered by generalized itching of his skin and has tried moisturizing lotions
and creams without improvement. He denies fevers, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea. He does think his stools have been lighter in color recently.
He has also noticed his urine is darker. He has no other medical history and takes
no medications except for a multivitamin. He drinks alcohol occasionally and
smokes cigars.
On examination, he is afebrile, with heart rate of 68 beats per minute (bpm)
and blood pressure of 128/74 mm Hg. He has a flat affect and a somewhat
disheveled appearance. He has noticeable icterus of his sclera and skin. His chest
is clear, and his heart rhythm is regular without murmurs. His abdomen is soft and
nontender with active bowel sounds, a liver span of 10 cm, and no splenomegaly
or masses. His skin has a few excoriations on his arms and back, but no rashes or
telangiectasias are present.
Blood is obtained for laboratory analysis; the results are available the next
day. His serum albumin is 3.1 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 588 IU/L, total bilirubin
8.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 175 IU/L, and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 140 IU/L. His hemoglobin level is 13.5 g/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 27:
Painless Jaundice, Pancreatic Cancer
Summary: A 57-year-old man presents with
Pruritus and weight loss

Light-colored stools and dark urine

Painless jaundice

Elevated alkaline phosphatase level and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia

Most likely diagnosis: Biliary obstruction, most likely caused by malignancy.
Next diagnostic step: Imaging procedure of his biliary system, initially ultrasonog-
raphy followed by computed tomographic (CT) scan.
Risk factors for pancreatic cancer: Smoking, alcohol use, obesity, age, and diabetes.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the causes and evaluation of a patient with unconjugated hyperbili-
rubinemia. (EPA 1, 2, 3)
2. Distinguish between hepatocellular disease and biliary obstruction.
(EPA 3)
3. Evaluate patients with cholestasis. (EPA 1, 3)
4. List the treatment and complications of biliary obstruction. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
In patients with jaundice, one must try to distinguish between hepatocellular and
biliary disease. In a patient with painless biliary obstruction, one should be suspi-
cious of malignancy or strictures. The findings in this case, such as generalized
pruritis and icterus, point toward cholestasis. The light-colored or acholic stools
suggest the cholestasis is most likely due to biliary obstruction since bile is what
causes stool to have its darker color. The absence of abdominal pain makes gall-
stone disease less likely, and in fact, nontender jaundice is suspicious for pancreatic
cancer.

APPROACH TO:
Painless Jaundice
DEFINITIONS
CHOLESTASIS: Deficient bile flow that can result from intrahepatic disease or
extrahepatic obstruction.
CONJUGATED BILIRUBIN (DIRECT-REACTING BILIRUBIN): Bilirubin
that has entered the liver and has been enzymatically bound to glucuronic acid,
forming the water-soluble bilirubin monoglucuronide or diglucuronide.
JAUNDICE OR ICTERUS: Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, indicating
hyperbilirubinemia.
UNCONJUGATED BILIRUBIN (INDIRECT-REACTING BILIRUBIN):
Bilirubin that has not been enzymatically bound to glucuronic acid by the liver and
is in the serum reversibly and noncovalently bound to albumin.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Jaundice, or icterus, is the visible manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia and usually
can be noticed by physical examination when the serum bilirubin level exceeds
2.0 to 2.5 mg/dL. Traditional instruction regarding the jaundiced patient divides
the mechanism of hyperbilirubinemia into prehepatic (excessive production of bili-
rubin), intrahepatic, or extrahepatic (as in biliary obstruction). For most patients
with jaundice, the focus should be on hepatic or biliary diseases that cause conju-
gated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia because they represent the most clinically impor-
tant causes of jaundice.
The term unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia is used when the conju-
gated (or direct-reacting fraction) does not exceed 15% of the total bilirubin. In
adults, it is almost always caused by hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome. In these con-
ditions, the serum bilirubin level almost always is less than 5 mg/dL, and there
are usually no other clinical signs of liver disease. In addition, there should be
no bilirubinuria (only conjugated bilirubin can be filtered and renally excreted).
Hemolysis usually is clinically apparent, as in sickle cell disease or autoimmune
hemolytic anemia. Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition caused by a deficiency
of hepatic enzymatic conjugation of bilirubin, which results in intermittent
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Total bilirubin is usually less than 4 g/dL and
is often precipitated by events such as stress, fasting, and febrile illnesses. It is not
associated with liver dysfunction and requires no therapy.
Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia almost always reflects either hepatocel-
lular disease or biliary obstruction. These two conditions can be differentiated by
the pattern of elevation of the liver enzymes. Elevation of serum AST and ALT
levels is characteristic of hepatocellular disease as a result of the inflammation/
destruction of the hepatocytes and the release of these enzymes into the blood.
28_Toy-IM_Case27_p287-294.indd 289 25/08/20 9:44 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,317,"290 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
The serum alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in cholestatic disease as a conse-
quence of inflammation, destruction, or obstruction of the intrahepatic or extra-
hepatic bile ducts with relative sparing of the hepatocytes. The serum AST and
ALT levels may be mildly elevated in cholestasis but usually not to the levels seen
in primary acute hepatocellular disease. Other tests, such as serum albumin or PT,
generally reflect the capacity of hepatocytes to synthesize proteins such as clotting
factors. When they are abnormal, they most often reflect hepatocellular disease.
Table 27–1 summarizes the liver test patterns seen in various categories of hepa-
tobiliary disorders.
Differential Diagnosis. The patient discussed in this case has a pattern consistent
with cholestasis, and the first diagnostic test in a patient with cholestasis usually
is an ultrasound. It is noninvasive and is very sensitive for detecting stones in the
gallbladder as well as intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The most
common cause of biliary obstruction in the United States is gallstones, which may
become lodged in the common bile duct. Obstructing stones causing jaundice usu-
ally are associated with epigastric or right upper quadrant colicky pain. Extrahe-
patic dilation without evidence of stones warrants further study with CT, magnetic
resonance cholangiopancreatography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancrea-
tography (ERCP). These imaging techniques may detect occult stones, strictures,
or malignancies that include cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and ampullary
cancer (ampulla of Vater).
Other possible causes of obstruction include strictures, which can result from
prior biliary surgery, prior inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis (rarely),
inflammatory diseases of the biliary tree, and infection in the setting of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two important primary biliary conditions
are primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Table 27–2 com-
pares features of these two entities.
The complications of biliary obstruction include development of acute cholan-
gitis as a result of ascending infection, or secondary hepatic cirrhosis if the obstruc-
tion is chronic or recurrent. The patient in this case scenario has painless jaundice,
liver enzymes consistent with a cholestatic process, and light-colored stools, sug-
gesting obstruction of bile flow into the intestine. Because he has no history of
abdominal or biliary surgery that might have caused a stricture, malignancy is the
most likely cause of his biliary obstruction. The most common malignancy with
this clinical presentation is pancreatic cancer. The patient should undergo an imag-
ing procedure of his abdomen, including a right upper quadrant ultrasound to
evaluate the biliary tree, as well as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
to visualize the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration of the
pancreas is highly accurate in establishing a tissue diagnosis.
Treatment
Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
Peak incidence is in the seventh decade of life, with two-thirds of cases occurring in
persons older than 65 years. The median survival is 9 months, with a dismal overall
5-year survival rate of 3%. Clinically apparent metastatic disease is found in 80% of
patients at the time of diagnosis. For patients without obvious metastases, the best

hope for cure is surgical resection by pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple proce-

5%. Even when the cancer is resectable, there is a high rate of recurrence. As such,
many treatment programs include neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Palliative measures
may include common bile duct stenting to relieve biliary obstruction. Several serum
markers for pancreatic cancer have been evaluated, the most useful of which
is CA 19-9. This marker has prognostic value and is also used as an indicator of
response to treatment and/or disease progression.
Unfortunately, there is no cure for primary biliary cirrhosis, but ursodeoxycholic
acid, steroids, and immunosuppressive agents can slow the progression of the
disease; ultimately, liver transplantation is the only option for end-stage disease.

ANSWERS
27.1 B. The patient’s laboratory results show a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with
evidence of hepatocellular disease (hypoalbuminemia, ascites). The AST and
ALT levels show the 2:1 ratio consistent with alcohol-related liver disease.
27.2 E. The patient’s laboratory results show a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
consistent with an obstructive pattern. She has the risk factors for gallstones
(female, obese, middle age) and has symptoms of postprandial abdominal
pain.
27.3 C. The patient’s laboratory results show an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
without other abnormality. He is otherwise healthy and without symptoms
of systemic disease or hemolytic anemia; this is suggestive of Gilbert disease.
No treatment is necessary.
27.4 F. The patient’s laboratory results show a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with
an obstructive pattern. The history is consistent with inflammatory bowel

evaluation should include ultrasonography to rule out gallstones; if negative,
ERCP could confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating multiple strictures of
the extrahepatic bile ducts. Treatment options include stenting of the larger
bile duct strictures and immunosuppression to slow the progression of the
disease.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia usually is caused by hemoly-
»
sis or Gilbert syndrome.
Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia is commonly caused by hepato-
»
cellular disease, with elevated AST and ALT levels, or biliary obstruction,
with elevated alkaline phosphatase level.
An imaging procedure such as ultrasonography is the initial study of

choice in a patient with cholestasis to evaluate for intrahepatic or extra-
hepatic biliary obstruction.
The most common causes of biliary obstruction are gallstones, which are

painful if obstructing, and strictures or neoplasms, which may be painless.
Pancreatic cancer is initially diagnosed and staged by CT; the best hope for

cure is resection by a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to differentiate glomerular from nonglomerular hematuria. (EPA 2, 3)
2. Understand the clinical features of GN. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Evaluate and treat a patient with GN. (EPA 1, 4)
4. Be familiar with the evaluation of a patient with nonglomerular hematuria.
(EPA 1, 7)
Considerations
A young man without a significant medical history now presents with new onset
of hypertension, edema, and hematuria following an upper respiratory tract infec-
tion. He has no history of renal disease, does not have manifestations of chronic
hypertension, and has not received any nephrotoxins. He does not have other
symptoms of inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
The presentation of acute renal failure, hypertension, edema, and hematuria in a
young man with no significant medical history is highly suggestive of glomerular
injury. He likely has acute GN, either postinfectious (streptococcal) or immuno-
globulin (Ig) A nephropathy. The reddish-brown appearance of the urine could
represent hematuria, which was later suggested by dipstick urinalysis (3+ blood);
hence, microscopic examination of the urine for RBCs is very important. Together,
the history and examination suggest that the patient likely has acute GN, either
primary GN of unknown etiology (no concomitant systemic disease is mentioned)

GN). The next logical step in diagnosing GN should be to examine the precipitate
of a freshly spun urine sample for active sediment (cellular components, red cell
casts, dysmorphic red cells). If present, these are signs of inflammation and estab-
lish the diagnosis of acute GN. Although likely to be present, these markers do
not distinguish among the distinct immune-mediated causes of GN; they merely
allow us to make the diagnosis of acute GN (primary or secondary). Further eval-
uation with serologic markers, such as complement levels and antistreptolysin-O
(ASO) titers (Table 28–1), may help to further classify the GN.

Pathophysiology
Hematuria. Direct visualization of a urine sample (gross hematuria) or dip-
stick examination (positive blood) can be helpful; however, the diagnosis of
hematuria is made by microscopic confirmation of the presence of red blood cells
(microscopic hematuria). The first step in evaluating a patient who complains of

Intrarenal hematuria

• Renal stones and crystals

• Infection (pyelonephritis)
• Neoplasia (renal cell carcinoma)
• Vascular injury (vasculitis, renal thrombosis)
Extrarenal hematuria
• Trauma (Foley placement)
• Infections (urethritis, prostatitis, cystitis)
• Nephrolithiasis (ureteral stones)
• Neoplasia (prostate, bladder)
red-dark urine is to differentiate between true hematuria (presence of RBCs in urine)
and pigmented urine (red-dark urine). The breakdown products of muscle cells
and RBCs (myoglobin and hemoglobin, respectively) are heme-containing com-
pounds capable of turning the color of urine dark red or brown in the absence of
true hematuria (RBCs). A dipstick urinalysis positive for blood without the pres-
ence of RBCs (negative microscopic cellular sediment) is suggestive of hemoglobin-
uria or myoglobinuria.
After confirmation, the etiology of the hematuria should be determined.
Hematuria can be classified into two broad categories: intrarenal and extrarenal
(Table 28–2). The history and physical examination are very helpful in the eval-
uation (age, fever, pain, family history). Laboratory analysis and imaging stud-
ies often are necessary, and considering the potential clinical implications, the
etiology of hematuria should be pursued in all cases. First, examination of the
cellular urine sediment can help to differentiate glomerular from nonglomeru-
lar hematuria. The presence of dysmorphic/fragmented RBCs or red cell casts is
indicative of glomerular origin (GN). Second, the urine Gram stain and culture
can aid in the diagnosis of infectious hematuria. Third, the urine sample should
be sent for cytologic evaluation when the diagnosis of malignancy is suspected.
Finally, renal imaging via ultrasound or CT scan can help in the visualization of
the renal parenchyma and vascular structures. Cystoscopy can be used to assess
the bladder.
Differential Diagnosis for Glomerular Disease. The approach to the patient with
glomerular disease should be systematic and undertaken in a stepwise fashion.
The history should be approached meticulously, looking for evidence of preexist-
ing renal disease, exposure to nephrotoxins, and especially any underlying systemic
illness. Serologic markers of systemic diseases should be obtained, if indicated
(Figure 28–1) in order to further classify the GN. Once the appropriate serologic
tests have been reviewed, a kidney biopsy may be required. A biopsy sample can be
examined under the light microscope in order to determine the primary histopatho-
logic injury to the nephron (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [MPGN],
crescentic GN, etc). Further examination of an immunofluorescent-stained sample
for immune recognition (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, or pauci-immune staining)

of the affected glomerular membrane (capillary, epithelial, etc) and inspection
under electron microscopy for characteristic patterns of immune deposition
(granular, linear GN) may provide a definitive diagnosis of the immune-mediated
injury to the glomeruli. Figure 28–1 shows an algorithmic approach to the
patient with acute GN.
A common clinical scenario is the need to distinguish between postinfectious
(usually streptococcal) GN and IgA nephropathy. Both illnesses can present with
GN occurring after an upper respiratory illness. The history can sometimes provide
a clue. In poststreptococcal GN (PSGN), the GN typically does not set in until
several weeks after the initial infection. In contrast, IgA nephropathy may present
with pharyngitis and GN at the same time. In addition, PSGN classically presents
with hypocomplementemia (predominantly low C3), and if the patient undergoes a
renal biopsy, there is evidence of an immune complex–mediated process. In con-
trast, IgA nephropathy has normal complement levels and negative ASO titer (IgA
levels may be elevated in about a third of patients, but this is nonspecific), and the
renal biopsy will show mesangial IgA.
Clinical Presentation
Glomerular disease is encountered mainly in the form of two distinct syndromes:
nephritic or nephrotic (or sometimes an overlap of the two syndromes). Nephritis
(nephritic syndrome) is defined as an inflammatory renal syndrome that presents
as hematuria, edema, hypertension, and a low degree of proteinuria (< 1-2 g/d).
Nephrosis (or nephrotic syndrome) is a noninflammatory (no active sediment in
the urine) glomerulopathy that causes heavy proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome is
distinguished by four features: (1) edema, (2) hypoalbuminemia, (3) hyperlipid-
emia, and (4) proteinuria (> 3 g/d). Glomerular injury may result from a variety
of insults and presents either as the sole clinical finding in a patient (primary renal
disease) or as part of a complex syndrome of a systemic disorder (secondary glo-
merular disease). For the purpose of this discussion, GN includes only the inflam-
matory glomerulopathies.
Nephritic Syndrome. The presentation of acute renal failure with associated
hypertension, hematuria, and edema is consistent with acute GN. Acute kidney
injury, as manifested by a decrease in urine output and azotemia, results from
impaired urine production and ineffective filtration of nitrogenous waste by the
glomerulus. Common signs suggesting an inflammatory glomerular cause of renal
failure (ie, acute GN) include hematuria (caused by ruptured capillaries in the
glomerulus), proteinuria (caused by altered permeability of the capillary walls),
edema (caused by salt and water retention), and hypertension (caused by fluid
retention and disturbed renal homeostasis of blood pressure). The presence of this
constellation of signs in a patient makes the diagnosis of GN very likely. However,
it is important to note that often patients present with an overlap syndrome, shar-
ing signs of both nephritis and nephrosis. Moreover, the presence of hematuria in
itself is not pathognomonic for GN because there are multiple causes of hematuria
of nonglomerular origin. Therefore, confirmation of the presumptive diagnosis of
acute GN requires microscopic examination of a urine sample from the patient.

Hepatitis C/hepatitis B–related glomerulonephritis (cryo-GN)
Vasculitis-related glomerulonephritis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss, polyarteri-
tis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura)
Infective endocarditis-related glomerulonephritis
The presence of red cell casts (inflammatory casts) or dysmorphic RBCs (caused
by filtration through damaged glomeruli) in a sample of spun urine establishes the
diagnosis of GN.
Once the diagnosis of acute GN is made, it can be broadly classified as
either primary (present clinically as a renal disorder) or secondary (renal injury
caused by a systemic disease). The specific diagnosis can usually be established
by clinical history and serologic evaluation and often requires a kidney biopsy
(Table 28–3).
Treatment
Treatment depends on the diagnosis of the GN, whether it is a primary renal dis-
ease or secondary to a systemic illness. When appropriate, the underlying disease
should be treated (infective endocarditis, hepatitis, SLE, or vasculitis). The use of
steroids and cyclophosphamide has been advocated in the treatment of GN induced
by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, while other antibody-mediated GNs
might require plasmapheresis in order to eliminate the inciting antibody-immune
complex. Treatment for PSGN is usually supportive, with control of hypertension
and edema, with a very good prognosis. There is no clearly defined treatment for
IgA nephropathy. However, general interventions to slow progression include
blood pressure control with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angio-
tensin II receptor blockers, as well as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive
agents to reduce underlying inflammatory disease.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
28.1 An 18-year-old marathon runner has been training during the summer. He
is brought to the emergency department disoriented after collapsing on the
track. His temperature is 102 °F. A Foley catheter is placed and reveals red-
dish urine with 3+ blood on dipstick and no cells seen microscopically. Which
of the following is the most likely explanation for his urine?
A. Underlying renal disease
B. Prerenal azotemia
C. Myoglobinuria
D. Glomerulonephritis
28.2 An 8-year-old boy is brought into the pediatrician’s office for fatigue, pain
of the joints, and red-brown colored urine of 2 days. On examination, the
blood pressure is 140/92 mm Hg, and heart rate is 90 beats per minute. He
has facial swelling and pedal edema. The heart, lung, and abdominal exami-
nations are normal. His mother states that about 3 weeks ago he had a sore
throat and fever. Which of the following laboratory findings would most
likely be present?
A. Elevated serum complement levels
B. Positive antinuclear antibody titers
C. Elevated ASO titers
D. Positive blood cultures
E. Positive cryoglobulin titers
28.3 A 22-year-old man complains of acute hemoptysis over the past week. He
denies smoking, fever, or preexisting lung disease. His blood pressure is
130/70 mm Hg, and his physical examination, including lung examination, is
normal. His urinalysis shows microscopic hematuria and RBC casts. Which
of the following is the most likely etiology?
A. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs
B. Acute tuberculosis of the kidneys and lungs
C. Systemic lupus erythematosus
D. Goodpasture disease (antiglomerular basement membrane)
ANSWERS
28.1 C. This individual is suffering from heat exhaustion, which can lead to rhab-
domyolysis and release of myoglobin. Myoglobinuria leads to a reddish
appearance and positive urine dipstick reaction for blood, but microscopic
analysis of the urine likely will demonstrate no red cells. Based on the history,
this diagnosis is most likely, and the other answer choices (answer A, underly-
ing renal disease; answer B, prerenal azotemia; and answer D, glomerulone-
phritis) are not as likely.

28.2 C. This child most likely has postinfectious GN based on the fever and
pharyngitis 3 weeks previously and now with hypertension, facial and pedal
edema, and hematuria. The ASO titers typically are elevated, and serum
complement levels are decreased (not increased, as in answer A) in PSGN.
Answer B (positive antinuclear antibody titers) would be more likely seen
in a patient with lupus nephritis along with decreased complement levels
(C3 and C4). Answer D (positive blood cultures) is more likely in a patient
with GN secondary to endocarditis, where valvular disease would also be
present. Answer E (positive cryoglobulin titers) is indicative of GN second-
ary to cryoglobulinemia, where the patient is also likely to test positive for
hepatitis C.
28.3 D. Goodpasture (antiglomerular basement membrane) disease typically
affects young males, who present with hemoptysis and hematuria. Antibody
against type IV collagen, expressed in the pulmonary alveolar and glomerular
basement membrane, leads to the pulmonary and renal manifestations. Gran-
ulomatosis with polyangiitis typically affects older adults and includes more
systemic symptoms such as arthralgias, myalgias, and sinonasal symptoms;
these patients are positive for ANCA. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the
lungs (answer A) is not as likely due to the patient’s young age and since he is
not a smoker. Acute tuberculosis of the lungs and kidneys (answer B) is not
usual, and since the patient does not have a travel history, night sweats, weight
loss, or fever, this is not likely. Systemic lupus erythematosus (answer C) can
cause GN (hematuria) but not hemoptysis; pleuritis is the typical pulmonary
manifestation.

Considerations
Patients develop significant proteinuria as a result of glomerular damage, which
can result from many systemic diseases. It is important to screen for diseases such
as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis, autoimmune diseases,
and malignancy by history. Physical examination and laboratory investigation can
usually determine the underlying cause of the renal manifestations, but sometimes
kidney biopsy is required.

APPROACH TO:
Nephrotic Syndrome
DEFINITION
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME: Urine protein excretion greater than 3.5 g over
24 hours, serum hypoalbuminemia (< 3 g/dL), hyperlipidemia, and edema.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Normally, the kidneys do not excrete appreciable amounts of protein (< 150 mg/d)
because serum proteins are excluded from the urine by the glomerular membrane
filter due to both their large size and their net negative charge. Thus, significant pro-
teinuria suggests glomerular disease with disruption of its normal barrier function.
Proteinuria in excess of 3 to 3.5 g of protein per day is considered to be in the nephrotic
range. The key feature of nephrotic syndrome is the heavy proteinuria, which leads
to loss of albumin and other serum proteins. The hypoalbuminemia and decreased
intravascular oncotic pressure lead to renal sodium and fluid retention. This results
in tissue edema, which usually starts in dependent areas, such as the feet, but may
involve the face, the hands, and ultimately the whole body (anasarca). Both increased
synthesis and decreased clearance of lipoproteins may lead to hyperlipidemia.
Clinical Presentation
Patients typically present complaining of the edema and have the laboratory fea-
tures described previously. Urinalysis usually shows few or no cellular elements
(bland sediment) and may show waxy casts or oval fat bodies (which look similar
to Maltese crosses under polarized light) if hyperlipidemia is present.
One-third of adult patients with nephrotic syndrome have a systemic disease
that involves the kidneys, such as diabetes mellitus or systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE). The rest have a primary renal disease, with one of four pathologic lesions:
minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulo-
sclerosis, or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Thus, a new diagnosis of
nephrotic syndrome warrants further investigation into an underlying systemic dis-
ease. Common tests include serum glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to
evaluate for diabetes, antinuclear antibody to screen for SLE, serum and urine pro-
tein electrophoresis to look for multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, and viral serolo-
gies because HIV and hepatitis B or C can cause nephrosis. Less common causes
include various cancers, medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
heavy metals such as mercury, and hereditary renal conditions. The most common
cause of nephrotic syndrome is diabetes mellitus.
Adults with nephrotic syndrome usually undergo renal biopsy, especially if the
underlying diagnosis is unclear or if there is a possibility of a treatable or revers-
ible condition. Patients with advanced diabetes who have heavy proteinuria and
evidence of microvascular disease, such as retinopathy, and no active cellular compo-
nents in their urinary sediment are generally presumed to have diabetic nephropathy.

Case Files Internal Medicine,335,"308 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
These patients typically do not undergo renal biopsy because the nephrotic pro-
teinuria represents irreversible glomerular damage.
Treatment
Treatment is as follows: (1) treat the underlying disease, (2) if present, manage the
edema and hypertension, and (3) limit the progression of the renal disease. For
edema, all patients require strict salt restriction, but most patients will also need
diuretics. Thiazide and loop diuretics are highly protein bound. Thus, in cases of
nephrotic syndrome with very low serum protein levels, there is reduced delivery of
these diuretics to the kidney, often creating the need for very large doses to manage
the edema. Dietary protein restriction is usually recommended for patients with
moderate proteinuria and chronic kidney disease and is thought to protect against
the progression of glomerular scarring.
Tight glycemic control with a goal hemoglobin A less than 7% has been shown to
1C
slow or prevent the progression of renal disease in patients with microalbuminuria.
Once macroalbuminuria has developed, however, it is not clear whether improved
glycemic control affects the course of renal disease. In addition, as renal function
declines, insulin requirements typically fall, and some oral medications, such as sul-
fonylureas and metformin, can be dangerous in advanced renal insufficiency.
Strict blood pressure control with a goal less than 130/80 mm Hg in all patients
with diabetes is essential to slow progression, as recommended by the 2017 American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.
Angiotensin inhibition, with either an ACE inhibitor or ARB, has been shown to
reduce the progression of renal disease independent of blood pressure control by
reducing intraglomerular filtration and proteinuria. If additional blood pressure
control is needed, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, or
diuretics may be added.
In addition, because cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death of diabet-
ics, aggressive risk factor reduction should be attempted, including smoking cessa-
tion and reduction of hypercholesterolemia. Patients with diabetes are regarded as
the highest risk category and should be treated with diet and statin agents. Previ-
ously, expert guidelines advised a goal of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
less than 100 mg/dL. Currently, there is debate about the use of discrete goals ver-
sus the initiation of moderate- or high-intensity statin agents for those without
cardiovascular disease based on cardiovascular risk (calculator: http://tools.acc
.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/). In general, diabetics
aged 40 and above should receive a statin agent because of the strong evidence of
cardiovascular primary prevention. If diabetic patients are known to have athero-
sclerotic coronary disease, they should achieve an LDL goal of less than 70 mg/dL.
Complications
Patients with nephrotic syndrome have consequences of renal protein wasting other
than edema. They have decreased levels of antithrombin III and proteins C and S and
are often hypercoagulable. This can lead to venous thromboembolism, including renal
vein thrombosis characterized by sudden flank pain, hematuria, and increased protein-
uria. Patients with evidence of thrombus formation require anticoagulation, often for
life. Other complications include hypogammaglobulinemia with increased infection risk
30_Toy-IM_Case29_p305-312.indd 308 25/08/20 9:46 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,336,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 309
(especially pneumococcal infection), iron deficiency anemia caused by hypotransfer-
rinemia, and vitamin D deficiency because of loss of vitamin D–binding protein.
During the progression of diabetic nephropathy, the glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) initially increases and then declines over time. The earliest stages of diabetic
nephropathy can be detected as microalbuminuria. This is defined as urine albumin
excretion between 30 and 300 mg/d. It is possible to measure this in a random urine
sample rather than a timed collection because a ratio of albumin (in milligrams)
to creatinine (in grams) of 30 to 300 usually correlates with the total excretion
described. When albuminuria exceeds 300 mg/d, it is detectable on ordinary urine
dipsticks (macroalbuminuria), and the patient is said to have overt nephropathy.
After the development of microalbuminuria, most patients will remain asymp-
tomatic. However, the glomerulopathy will continue to progress over the subse-
quent 5 to 10 years until overt nephropathy develops. At this point, many patients
have some edema, and nearly all patients have developed hypertension. The pres-
ence of hypertension will markedly accelerate the decline of renal function. If left
untreated, patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), usually requiring
dialysis or transplant within a 5- to 15-year period.
The development of nephropathy and proteinuria is significant because they are
associated with a much higher risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading
cause of death in patients with diabetes. By the time patients with diabetes develop
ESRD and require dialysis, the average life expectancy is shorter than 2 years.

ANSWERS
29.1 D. The most significant finding in this patient is the presence of protein-
uria, which is a foreboding sign of diabetic nephropathy. Starting an ACE
inhibitor to decrease proteinuria is the best choice for initial treatment for
this patient. Changing from one sulfonylurea to another (answer C) is of no
benefit because all of the agents are essentially equally efficacious. There is no
indication for referral to a cardiologist (answer E) based on the information

Case Files Internal Medicine,338,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 311
provided in the vignette. Returning for another urinalysis in 6 weeks (answer A)
is not prudent since there is already evidence of significant proteinuria.
Metoprolol (answer B) will not help with the proteinuria and can also mask
the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
29.2 C. This patient has hypertension and urinary sediment consistent with
a nephritic rather than nephrotic syndrome (RBC casts, mild degree
of proteinuria). Given his recent episode of pharyngitis, the most likely
cause would be postinfectious, probably due to streptococcal infection. SLE
(answer A) can produce a variety of renal diseases with both nephritic and
nephrotic manifestations. However, SLE would be unlikely in a male patient,
especially without other clinical manifestations of lupus, such as arthritis.
Amyloidosis (answer B), diabetes (answer E), and HIV (answer D) all cause
renal disease, but they more commonly cause nephrotic syndrome.
29.3 A. Although a 24-hour urine collection for creatinine (answer E) may be
useful in assessing declining GFR, it is not the best screening test for the
diagnosis of early diabetic nephropathy. In the outpatient setting, a dip-
stick urinalysis (answer B) is readily available but will detect only patients
with overt nephropathy (proteinuria > 300 mg/d). Thus, a random urinary
albumin/creatinine ratio of 30/300 is the best test to screen for early diabetic
nephropathy. A fasting blood glucose (answer D) may aid in the diagnosis of
diabetes but not nephropathy. Finally, although most patients with nephrotic
syndrome require a renal biopsy (answer C) for diagnosis, a patient with
worsening renal function who has had long-standing diabetes is assumed to
have renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy. Most of these patients
do not undergo a renal biopsy.
29.4 D. This patient should be started on a statin agent. Patients with diabetes
are considered at high risk for the development of coronary artery disease,
and a statin agent should be initiated unless contraindicated. Previously,
strong consideration was given for strict LDL goals such as LDL of less than
100 mg/dL for primary prevention of cardiac disease; however, the ACC
currently recommends the use of a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) risk calculator and moderate-dose versus high-intensity
dose statin therapy based on risk. This patient’s 10-year ASCVD risk result
is 15%, and the recommendation would be that a statin agent of moder-
ate intensity be initiated. Additionally, statin agents have been shown to be
effective in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetics
aged 40 to 75. Answer A (niacin) has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol,
but it has not been shown to reduce mortality. Answer C (gemfibrozil) is
used primarily to treat a mixed dyslipidemia such as hypertriglyceridemia
and high LDL; however, this agent is not as efficacious in reducing car-
diovascular mortality as statin agents. Answer B (low-protein diet) is not
indicated in this situation since the patient has no proteinuria and a normal
serum creatinine level.

Possible prevention: Intravenous hydration with normal saline prior to angiography.
Next diagnostic step: Urinalysis and urine chemistries to determine whether the
process is prerenal, intrinsic renal, or less likely postrenal.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the common causes, evaluation, and prevention of AKI in hospitalized
patients. (EPA 1, 2, 3)
2. Appraise urinalysis and serum chemistry values in the diagnostic approach of
AKI to be able to categorize the etiology as prerenal, renal, or postrenal. (EPA 3)
3. Discuss the management of hyperkalemia and indications for acute dialysis.
(EPA 4, 9, 10)
Considerations
A 54-year-old man with diabetes, retinopathy, and some chronic kidney disease
develops AKI in the hospital, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine level
of 2.9 mg/dL and BUN of 69 mg/dL. He has undergone several medical therapies
and procedures, all of which might be potentially contributory: acute lowering of
his blood pressure, ACE inhibitor, iodinated radiocontrast media, and arterial cath-
eterization with possible atheroemboli. The mortality rate associated with critically
ill patients who develop AKI is high; thus, identifying and treating the underlying
etiology of this patient’s kidney failure and taking measures to protect the kidneys
from further damage are essential.

APPROACH TO:
Acute Kidney Injury
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Abrupt decline in kidney function, measured as
decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). True GFR is difficult to measure, so
we rely on increases in serum creatinine levels or decreases in urine production to
indicate a fall in GFR.
ANURIA: Less than 50 mL of urine output in 24 hours. Acute obstruction, cortical
necrosis, and vascular catastrophes, such as aortic dissection, should be considered
in the differential diagnosis.
OLIGURIA: Less than 400 mL of urine output in 24 hours. Physiologically, it
is the lowest amount of urine a person on a normal diet can make if he or she is
severely dehydrated and does not retain uremic waste products. Oliguria is a poor
prognostic sign in AKI. Patients with oliguric renal failure have higher mortality rates
and worse renal recovery than patients who are nonoliguric.
UREMIA: Nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, weakness, nausea with early morning
vomiting, itchiness, confusion, pericarditis, and coma attributed to the retention of
waste products in renal failure but do not always correlate with the BUN level.
A highly malnourished patient with renal failure may have a modestly elevated
BUN and be uremic. Another patient may have a highly elevated BUN and be
asymptomatic. Elevated BUN without symptoms is called azotemia.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
The differential diagnosis of AKI proceeds from consideration of three basic
pathophysiologic mechanisms: prerenal failure, postrenal failure, and intrinsic renal
failure.
Individuals with prerenal failure experience diminished GFR as a result of a
marked decreased renal blood perfusion so that less glomerular filtrate is formed.
Sometimes, the clinical presentation is straightforward, such as volume deple-
tion from gastrointestinal fluid loss or hemorrhage; other times, the presentation
of patients with prerenal failure can be more confusing. For example, a patient
with severe nephrotic syndrome may appear to be volume overloaded because
of the massive peripheral edema present; however, the effective arterial blood
volume is very low as a consequence of severe hypoalbuminemia, resulting in a
prerenal AKI. Similarly, a patient with severe congestive heart failure may have
prerenal failure because of a low cardiac ejection fraction, yet at the same time be
fluid overloaded with peripheral and pulmonary edema. The key is to assess “what
the kidneys see” versus the remainder of the body. Typically, the BUN:Cr ratio
is greater than 20 in prerenal failure. Medications such as aspirin, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, and ACE inhibitors can alter intrarenal blood flow and

result in prerenal failure. Table 30–1 provides an abbreviated listing of the etiolo-
gies of prerenal failure.
Postrenal failure, also referred to as obstructive nephropathy, implies blockage
of urinary flow. The site of obstruction can be anywhere along the urinary system,
including the intratubular region (crystals), ureters (stones, extrinsic compression
by tumor), bladder, or urethra. By far, the most common causes of obstructive
nephropathy are ureteral obstruction due to malignancy or urethral obstruction
due to benign or malignant prostatic hypertrophy. The patient’s symptoms depend
on whether or not both kidneys are involved, the degree of obstruction, and the
time course of the blockage. This is usually diagnosed by observing hydronephrosis
or bladder distension on ultrasound.
Intrinsic renal failure is caused by disorders that injure the renal glomeruli or
tubules directly. These include glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis,
and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from ischemia, sepsis, or nephrotoxic agents.
Table 30–2 lists major causes of intrinsic AKI.
Clinical Presentation
A thorough history and physical examination are important. Questions that are
important to ask include
Does the patient have signs or symptoms of a systemic disease, such as heart

failure or cirrhosis, that could cause prerenal failure?
Does the patient have symptoms of a disease, such as lupus, that could cause a

glomerulonephritis?
Did the patient receive something in the hospital that could cause ATN, such

as intravenous contrast or an aminoglycoside?


rhage causing ischemic ATN?


In addition to the history and physical examination, urinalysis and measurement
of urinary electrolytes are helpful in making the diagnosis.
Urinalysis. The urine findings based on testing with reagent paper and micro-
scopic examination help with the diagnosis of AKI (Table 30–3). In prerenal fail-
ure, urinalysis usually reveals a high specific gravity and normal microscopic findings.
Individuals with postrenal failure are typically unable to concentrate the urine, so
the urine osmolality is equal to the serum osmolality (isosthenuria), and the spe-
cific gravity is 1.010. The microscopic findings vary depending on the cause of the
obstruction: hematuria (crystals or stones), leukocytes (prostatic hypertrophy), or
normal (extrinsic ureteral compression from a tumor). Urinalysis of various intrin-
sic renal disorders may be helpful. Ischemic, septic, and nephrotoxic ATN are usually
associated with urine that is isosthenuric, often with proteinuria, and containing
“muddy brown” granular casts on microscopy. In glomerulonephritis, the urine gen-
erally reveals moderate-to-severe proteinuria, sometimes in the nephrotic range,
and microscopic hematuria and red blood cell casts. Tubulointerstitial nephritis clas-
sically produces urine that is isosthenuric (the tubules are unable to concentrate the
urine) with mild proteinuria. On microscopy, it usually reveals leukocytes, white cell
casts, and sometimes urinary eosinophils.

Na
NOTE: Though it remains widely used, the reliability of FENa to assess renal failure is poor since its conclusions arise from
a very small study. It is important to highlight that, if there is suspicion for hypovolemia, rather than measuring FENa, it is
more practical to assess the patient’s response to fluid resuscitation.
Urinary Electrolytes. Calculation of the fractional excretion of sodium (FE )
Na
was devised to differentiate oliguric prerenal failure from oliguric ATN; it is of
little use in other circumstances. FE represents the amount of sodium filtered
Na
by the kidneys that is not reabsorbed. The kidneys of a healthy person on a normal
diet typically reabsorb more than 99% of the sodium that is filtered, with a corre-
sponding FE less than 1%. Normally, the excreted sodium represents the dietary
Na
intake of sodium as a result of the maintenance of sodium homeostasis. In prerenal
failure, decreased renal perfusion leads to a diminished GFR; if the renal tubular
function is intact, FE remains less than 1%. Furthermore, because the patient
Na
has either true volume depletion or “effective” volume depletion, serum aldosterone
will stimulate the kidneys to retain sodium, and the urinary sodium will be low
(< 20 mEq/L). On the other hand, in oliguric ATN, the renal failure is caused by
tubular injury. Hence, there is tubular dysfunction with an associated inability to
reabsorb sodium, leading to a FE greater than 2% and a urinary sodium exceeding
Na
20 mEq/L.
Measurements of FE and urinary sodium are less helpful in other circum-
Na
stances. For example, in nonoliguric ATN, the injury is usually less severe, so
the kidneys may maintain normal sodium reabsorption and a FE less than 1%.
Na
Diuretic medications, which interfere with sodium reabsorption, are often used
for congestive heart failure or nephrotic syndrome. Although these patients may
have prerenal failure, the use of diuretics will increase the urinary sodium and
FE . In acute glomerulonephritis, the kidneys often avidly resorb sodium, leading
Na
to very low urinary sodium levels and FE . Early in the course of postobstructive

Case Files Internal Medicine,346,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 319
renal failure caused by ureteral obstruction, the afferent arteriole typically under-
goes intense vasoconstriction, with consequent low urinary sodium levels (Table
30–3).
Treatment
AKI is managed by identifying and reversing the underlying cause. Intravenous
isotonic fluids are a mainstay of treatment for any prerenal AKI caused by true vol-
ume depletion. Diuretics, on the other hand, would be used to treat prerenal AKI
in the setting of venous congestion in heart failure. Other common interventions
include removing nephrotoxic medications, optimizing blood pressure and elec-
trolytes, and administering diuretics. If the AKI is severe, the patient may require
urgent hemodialysis.
The indications for dialysis in AKI include fluid overload (such as pulmonary
edema), metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, uremic pericarditis, severe hyperphospha-
temia, and uremic symptoms refractory to medical treatment. Because of the risk
of fatal cardiac arrhythmias, severe hyperkalemia is considered an emergency best
treated acutely medically, not with dialysis.
An urgent electrocardiogram should be performed on any patient with sus-
pected hyperkalemia. If the classic peaked or “tented” T waves are present, intra-
venous calcium should be administered immediately. Although it will not lower
the serum potassium level, the calcium will oppose the membrane effects of the
high potassium concentration on the heart, allowing time for other interven-
tions to lower the potassium level. One of the most effective methods for treat-
ing hyperkalemia is administration of intravenous insulin (usually 10 units),
along with 50 to 100 mL of 50% glucose solution to prevent hypoglycemia. Insu-
lin drives potassium into cells, lowering levels within 30 minutes. Potassium can
also be driven intracellularly with a beta-agonist nebulizer, such as albuterol.
In the presence of a severe metabolic acidosis, administration of intravenous
sodium bicarbonate also promotes an intracellular shift of potassium, albeit less
effectively. All three therapies have only a transient effect of lowering serum
potassium levels because the total body potassium balance is unchanged, and the
potassium eventually leaks back out of the cells. Definitive treatment of hyper-
kalemia, removal of potassium from the body, is accomplished by one of three
methods: (1) administration of a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide) to increase uri-
nary flow and excretion of potassium; (2) administration of potassium-binding
cationic exchange resin (eg, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, or sodium
zirconium cyclosilicate) to prevent gastrointestinal absorption of potassium; or,
finally, (3) dialysis.
Dose adjustment of medications that are excreted through the kidneys is neces-
sary to prevent dose-related toxicity, even if the toxicity affects other organs.

30.2 A 49-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic renal failure as a
consequence of diabetic nephropathy is brought to the emergency room for
nausea, lethargy, and confusion. His physical examination is significant for
an elevated jugular venous pressure, clear lung fields, and harsh systolic
and diastolic sounds heard over the precordium. Serum chemistries reveal
K 5.1 mEq/L, CO 17 mEq/L, BUN 145 mg/dL, and creatinine 9.8 mg/dL.

ANSWERS
30.1 B. Renal ultrasound is the next appropriate step to assess for hydronephrosis
and to evaluate for bilateral ureteral obstructions, which are common sites of
metastases of cervical cancer. Her physical examination and urine studies
(showing a FE > 1%) are inconsistent with hypovolemia, so intravenous infu-
sion (answer A) is unlikely to improve her renal function. Use of loop diuretics
(answer D) may increase her urine output somewhat but does not help to
diagnose the cause of her renal failure or to improve her outcome. Further
imaging (answer C) may be necessary after the ultrasound, but use of intrave-
nous contrast at this point may actually worsen her renal failure.
30.2 D. The patient has uremia, hyperkalemia, and (likely) uremic pericarditis
(harsh systolic and diastolic sounds of friction rub), which may progress to
life-threatening cardiac tamponade unless the underlying renal failure is
treated with dialysis. If the threat of tamponade is significant, pericardiocen-
tesis may need to be performed prior to dialysis. As for the other treatments,
insulin plus glucose (answer A) would treat hyperkalemia, and bicarbonate
(answer B) would help with both metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia, but
this patient’s potassium and bicarbonate levels are only mildly abnormal and
are not immediately life threatening. Furosemide (answer C) will not help
because the patient does not have pulmonary edema; additionally, due to the
renal insufficiency, the furosemide likely would not lead to much potassium
excretion.
30.3 B. This elderly man has findings of renal insufficiency with two possible
causes: prerenal due to volume depletion and acute kidney injury due
to gentamicin/hypotension. The patient’s urinary sodium of 10 mEq/L
points to a prerenal cause. Prerenal insufficiency connotes insufficient
blood volume, typically with FE less than 1% (not answer A, 3%) and
Na
urinary sodium less than 20 mEq/L. Supporting data would include a
low central venous pressure reading (normal central venous pressure is
4-8 mm Hg), not an elevated reading of 10 mm Hg (answer C). The genta-
micin level of 4 µg/mL is elevated (normal < 2 µg/mL) and may predispose
to kidney damage, but intrarenally, thus ruling out answer D.

The two main causes of AKI in hospitalized patients are prerenal azotemia

from volume depletion and ATN.
In the acutely anuric patient, one must quickly determine if the kidneys

are obstructed or if the vascular supply is interrupted.
Treatment of prerenal failure is volume replacement unless the cause is

severe systolic heart failure; treatment of postrenal failure is relief of the
obstruction.
The main causes of postrenal failure are obstruction caused by prostatic

hypertrophy in men and bilateral ureteral obstruction caused by abdom-

Uremic pericarditis is an indication for urgent hemodialysis. Other indica-

Treatment of hyperkalemia can be remembered by the mnemonic

C BIG K (calcium, bicarbonate/beta-agonist, insulin, glucose, Kayexalate

Hyperkalemia is treated initially with calcium to stabilize cardiac mem-

branes (if there are electrocardiographic abnormalities); insulin and beta-
agonists to redistribute potassium intracellularly (sodium bicarbonate if
there is a severe metabolic acidosis); and then loop diuretics, a potassium
exchange resin, or hemodialysis to remove excess potassium from the
body.

A 56-year-old woman presents to the office complaining of gradually progressive,
nonpainful enlargement of the terminal joint on her left hand over a 9-month
period. She has some stiffness with typing, usually in the afternoons. She also
reports pain in her right knee, which occasionally “locks up.” The right knee hurts
more after long walks. On examination, her blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg,
heart rate is 80 beats per minute (bpm), height is 5’8”, and weight is 285 lb with
a body mass index (BMI) of 43.3 kg/m2. Examination reveals only a nontender
enlargement of her left distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and the right knee is
noted to have crepitus and slightly decreased range of motion (ROM). Those joints
were not red or swollen.

ANSWERS TO CASE 31:
Osteoarthritis/Degenerative Joint Disease
Summary: A 56-year-old woman presents with
Normal vital signs

Obesity

Joint pain in the left DIP and right knee that worsens with activity

Crepitus and slightly decreased ROM of the right knee

No synovitis on examination

Next step: Obtain erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plain x-rays of the
hand and knee.
Most likely diagnosis: Osteoarthritis (OA), because the patient is obese and has
pain that worsens with activity.
Best initial treatment: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or acet-
aminophen for pain management.
Risk factors: Obesity, repeated trauma.
Prevention: Weight loss, regular exercise.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the major clinical characteristics of OA. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Describe the management of OA. (EPA 4)
3. Understand the major classes of medications used for OA. (EPA 4)
4. Differentiate OA from inflammatory arthritis. (EPA 1, 2)
Considerations
This patient’s history and examination are characteristic of OA. Laboratory
work, typically negative for inflammatory arthritis, and x-rays would support
the diagnosis, mostly by making other diagnoses less likely. The most important
features are the gradual onset, the lack of active synovitis, and the fact that her
symptoms worsen with activity. If there were evidence of inflammation or joint
effusion, then the best next step would be to aspirate the fluid from the joint and
send it for various studies, including Gram stain and culture to assess for infec-
tion, crystal analysis to assess for gout or pseudogout, and cell count to assess for
inflammation.

APPROACH TO:
Osteoarthritis
DEFINITIONS
BOUCHARD NODES: Bony enlargement of proximal interphalangeal (PIP)
joints, often asymptomatic.
CREPITUS: A creaking or hook-and-loop (Velcro)–like sound made by a joint in
motion, typically not painful.
HEBERDEN NODES: Bony enlargement of DIP joints, often asymptomatic.
SYNOVITIS: Inflammation of the joint space characterized by redness, swelling,
and tenderness to touch.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
OA is the most common joint disease in adults. It is uncommon before age 40 but
highly prevalent after age 60. The disease affects women more often than men. OA
begins insidiously, progresses slowly, and eventually may lead to disability, recur-
rent falls, inability to live independently, and significant morbidity.
It is critical to differentiate OA from other conditions that may present similarly
since treatment is different. Periarticular pain that is not reproduced with pas-
sive motion suggests bursitis or tendonitis. Prolonged pain lasting for more than
1 hour after awakening points toward an inflammatory arthritis. Intense inflam-
mation suggests one of the microcrystalline diseases (gout/pseudogout) or infec-
tious arthritis. Systemic constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue,
fever, anorexia, and malaise, indicate an underlying inflammatory condition and
generally demand aggressive evaluation; these underlying conditions include poly-
myalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus,
and malignancy.
Clinical Presentation
Patients with OA often experience joint stiffness, which occurs with activity or after
inactivity (“gel phenomena”) and lasts for less than 15 to 30 minutes. This is in
contrast to the morning stiffness of patients with an inflammatory arthritis, such
as RA, which often lasts for 1 to 2 hours in the morning, upon wakening, and often
requires warming, such as soaking in a hot tub, to improve. In early OA, there are
no obvious findings. The knees and hips are the most commonly affected joints,
followed by the hand and finger joints.
There may be some crepitus in the joint. Unlike in inflammatory arthritis, there
is often no or minimal tissue swelling (except in the most advanced disease). Bony
prominences, especially in the DIP/PIP joints, can occur later. Hard or bony swell-
ing in the DIP joints are called Heberden nodes, whereas those affecting the PIP
joints are called Bouchard nodes. Figure 31–1 shows a typical joint involvement in

OA versus RA. Pain seen in OA typically can be reproduced with passive motion
of the joint.
Labs/Imaging. Laboratory examination typically is unremarkable; inflamma-
tory markers such as ESR, C-reactive protein, and white blood cells (WBCs) all
are normal. Likewise, autoimmune studies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA),
32_Toy-IM_Case31_p323-330.indd 326 03/09/20 6:59 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,354,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 327
rheumatoid factor, and complement levels also are normal. If the joint is aspirated,
examination of the synovial fluid also reflects a lack of inflammation: WBCs less
than 2000/mm3, protein lower than 45 mg/dL, absence of crystals, and glucose
equal to that in the serum. X-ray evaluation in OA may show osteophytes, which are
the most specific finding of this disease. However, osteophytes may not be present in
early stages of OA. Other characteristics seen on x-rays include joint space narrow-
ing, subchondral sclerosis, and subchondral cysts.
Treatment
Education is critical. Encourage the patient to stay active because not using the
joint can cause further immobility. Multiple short periods of rest throughout the
day are better than one large period. In patients with OA who are overweight,
weight loss of even modest degree may produce improvement in lower extremity
joint pain and function. Other methods of unloading an osteoarthritic joint include
canes and walkers, which can reduce joint forces at the hip by as much as 50% and
are helpful in reducing the frequency of falls. Physical therapy in the form of heat
applied to the affected joints in early disease is often helpful. Moist superficial heat
can raise the threshold for pain, produce analgesia by acting on free nerve endings,
and decrease muscle spasm.
Perhaps the most important intervention is having the patient maintain
full/near-full ROM with regular exercise. Physical therapy and exercise improve
functional outcome and pain in OA by improving flexibility and by strengthen-
ing muscles that support the affected joints.
Nonpharmacologic interventions should be tried first for pain management, for
functional capacity, and for slowing the process of joint damage. Pharmacologic inter-
ventions should then be added for patients with inadequate symptom relief to fur-
ther decrease the pain burden. The standard of care involves starting with oral
or topical NSAIDs. NSAID use is contraindicated in patients with a history of
peptic ulcers, cardiovascular disease (stroke, myocardial infarction), uncontrolled
hypertension, kidney disease, or women in their third trimester of pregnancy due
to premature closure of the patent ductus arteriosus. NSAIDs have a higher risk
of gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding, and both NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase
2 (COX-2) inhibitors are associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular
effects. Because of these risks, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors should be used in
the lowest dose necessary and for the shortest period in order to achieve symptom
control. Nevertheless, NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen in controlling pain
among patients with OA.
Topical medications such as diclofenac, lidocaine, or capsaicin may be consid-
ered in patients who cannot tolerate oral NSAIDs or for those at higher risk for
adverse effects (eg, patients over 75 years or those with significant cardiovascular
disease). Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has also
been approved for knee OA.
The use of glucosamine and chondroitin for OA has been controversial, and
results of randomized trials have varied. Though these medications appear to be
safe, most studies suggest that glucosamine and chondroitin have little benefit in
patients with OA.
32_Toy-IM_Case31_p323-330.indd 327 03/09/20 6:59 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,355,"328 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Oral steroids are generally not used to treat OA. Intra-articular steroids are used
for patients seeking short-term pain relief for moderate-to-severe pain flare-ups
but are not useful for long-term treatment due to their relatively short duration of
action (up to 6 weeks) and the possibility that long-term use may increase the rate
of cartilage loss.
Surgery is reserved for only the most severe cases, which include patients who
have major instability, a loose body in the joint (known as a joint mouse), intrac-
table pain of advanced disease, or severe functional limitation. Arthroscopic
debridement is widely used for those with symptomatic OA of the knee, espe-
cially with a meniscal tear, but clinical benefit is not supported by randomized
clinical trials. Total joint arthroplasty (eg, knee replacement) is recommended for
patients with severe symptomatic OA who fail to respond to optimal nonphar-
macologic and medical therapy and for whom OA causes significant impairment
in quality of life.

discharge in a 25-year-old woman
31.6 Unilateral nontender bony enlargement of the first DIP and activity-related
right hip pain in a 68-year-old woman
ANSWERS
31.1 A. This patient is presumed to have advanced OA. OA is a major cause of
decreased functional status in elderly patients and requires ongoing treatment
and evaluation by the clinician to try to improve symptoms and to promote
mobility. Steroids are not a treatment of OA since it is not an inflammatory
condition. Improvement with oral steroids (answer C) and activity through-
out the day (answer D) are more characteristic of RA. Joints that exhibit
redness and effusion (answer B) are more likely due to crystalline or septic
arthritis.
31.2 E. Based on this patient having noninflamed joints and with the DIP and
PIP joints of the hands affected, the most likely diagnosis is OA. RA would
affect the knees and hips also, but usually with inflammation and effusion;
in the hands, RA classically affects the metacarpophalangeal (MP) and
PIP joints of the hands. Acetaminophen is the first agent of choice in the
treatment of early OA. NSAIDs are superior in the treatment of OA;
however, given this patient’s comorbidity of cardiovascular disease, NSAIDs
(answers A and B) are relatively contraindicated. This is because of the
association between NSAIDs and cardiovascular and renal disease. Thus,
acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs would be better. Because this patient
has a noninflammatory condition, neither oral nor intra-articular steroids
are indicated (answers C and D).
31.3 E. Rheumatoid arthritis gives the ulnar deviation of the fingers by affecting
the MP joints (in fact, one of the hallmarks of the disease). Other deformities
associated with RA include the swan neck (MP flexion with PIP hyperexten-
sion and DIP flexion) and boutonniere (PIP flexion, DIP hyperextension)
deformities.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Osteoarthritis is the most common articular disease of adults, most often
»
affecting the DIP joints, PIP joints, knees, hip joints, and cervical and
lumbar spine.
The pathophysiology of OA is a “wear and tear” of the joint, leading to
»
intra-articular cartilage erosion and decreased joint space on radiograph.
Pain in OA is worsened with activity and is not associated with morning
»
stiffness.
Current pharmacologic agents do not modify or stop disease progres-
»
sion. Treatment is aimed at symptom relief.
Initial pharmacologic therapy should be NSAIDs, unless a contraindi-
»
cation, such as cardiovascular disease, gastric ulcers, or chronic kidney
disease, is present.
Joint replacement for severe OA is reserved for patients with intracta-
»
ble pain despite medical therapy and for those with severe functional
limitations.
31.4 B. Gouty arthritis often affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the feet
and can be precipitated by alcohol or foods high in nucleic acids, like meats.
There is often a familial predisposition. Uric acid crystals form in the joints
and cause a severe inflammatory condition, redness, and pain.
31.5 A. Cervical discharge and inflammatory joint are consistent with gonococcal
arthritis, which can also present as a migratory arthritis of large joints; this is
an inflammatory condition with redness, pain, fever, and effusion.
31.6 D. The location and asymmetry of joint involvement, lack of inflammatory
signs, and worsening with exertion all are characteristic of OA. RA is typi-
cally symmetric.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the history and physical examination findings that help to distin-
guish benign musculoskeletal low back pain from more serious causes of low
back pain. (EPA 1, 2)
2. List the treatment options and their effectiveness in low back pain. (EPA 4)
3. Describe the indications for laboratory and imaging tests in evaluating low
back pain. (EPA 3)
Considerations
This 45-year-old patient with chronic back pain has an acute exacerbation with
pain radiating down her leg, which may indicate possible sciatic nerve compres-
sion. She has no other neurologic abnormalities, such as sensory deficits, motor
weakness, or “red flag” symptoms of more serious etiologies of back pain, which if
present would demand a more urgent evaluation. Thus, this individual has a good
prognosis for recovery with conservative therapy, perhaps with time being the most
important factor. If she does not improve after 4 to 6 weeks, imaging studies can
be considered.

APPROACH TO:
Low Back Pain
DEFINITIONS
CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME: Lower back pain, saddle anesthesia, and bowel
or bladder dysfunction with possible lower extremity weakness and loss of reflexes
caused by compression of multiple sacral nerve roots. Cauda equina syndrome is a
surgical emergency.
HERNIATED DISK (NUCLEUS PULPOSUS): Condition in which the annulus
fibrosus (outer layer) of the vertebral disk is torn, which allows the nucleus portion
to herniate and compress the nerve fibers adjacent, leading to paresthesia, dysesthe-
sia, and sometimes weakness.
SCIATICA: Pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, made up by the roots of
the lumbar nerves L4 and L5, and the sacral nerves S1, S2, and S3; it can present
with or without motor or sensory deficits.
SPINAL STENOSIS: Narrowing of the spinal canal, nerve root, or intervertebral
foramina due to spondylosis and degenerative disk disease. Symptoms include back
pain with numbness or tingling of the legs, which increases with activity and is bet-
ter with sitting, lying down, or leaning forward.
SPONDYLOLISTHESIS: Anterior displacement of a vertebra on the one beneath
it, which can cause symptoms and signs of spinal stenosis.
SPONDYLOSIS: Osteoarthritic spine disease, typically affecting cervical and lum-
bosacral spine, seen radiographically as disk space narrowing and arthritic changes
of the facet joints.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Low back pain is experienced by two-thirds of all adults at some point in their lives.
There are approximately 20 million annual ambulatory visits because of low back
pain. This complaint is most common in adults in their working years, usually
affecting patients between 30 and 60 years, with a prevalence of 80%. Although
it is common in workers required to perform lifting and twisting, it is also a com-
mon complaint in those who sit or stand for prolonged periods. Low back pain
is a recurrent symptom that tends to be mild in younger patients, often resolving
within 2 weeks, but it can be more severe and prolonged as the patient ages. It is
one of the most common reasons for young adults to seek medical care, second only
to upper respiratory infections, and millions of health care dollars are expended on
this problem each year.
Pathophysiology
In evaluating patients with low back pain, the clinician needs to exclude poten-
tially serious conditions, such as malignancy, infection, inflammatory back pain

Table 32–1 • CAUSES OF LOWER BACK PAIN
Structural • Mechanical or nonspecific (90% of cases)
• Facet joint arthritis
• Prolapsed disk
• Annular tear
• Spondylosis
• Spinal stenosis (3%)
Infectious • Diskitis
• Osteomyelitis
• Paraspinal abscess
Neoplasm • Primary or secondary (metastasis)
Inflammatory • Spondylarthropathies
• Sacroiliitis
Referred pain to spine • From major viscera, retroperitoneal structures, genitourinary,
aorta, or hip
Metabolic • Osteoporotic vertebral collapse (3%-6%)
• Paget disease
• Osteomalacia
• Hyperparathyroidism
(eg, ankylosing spondyloarthritis), and dangerous neurologic processes, such as
spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Individuals without these con-
ditions are initially managed with conservative therapy. Nearly all patients recover
spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks, but a small percentage develops chronic
mechanical low back pain. If patients do not improve within 4 weeks with conser-
vative management, another etiology of the back pain might be present, and further
evaluation may be necessary, especially in patients with localized pain, nocturnal
pain, or sciatica.
The potential causes of back pain are numerous (Table 32–1). Pain can emanate
from the bones, ligaments, muscles, or nerves. Rarely, it can be a result of referred
pain from a visceral organ or other structure. Back pain with radiation down the
back of the leg suggests sciatic nerve root compression, generally caused by a her-
niated intervertebral disk at the L4–L5 or L5–S1 level. Patients typically report
aching pain in the buttock and paresthesias radiating into the posterior thigh and
calf or lateral foreleg. When pain radiates below the knee as opposed to just the
posterior thigh, it is more likely to indicate a true radiculopathy than radiation only
to the posterior thigh. A history of persistent leg numbness or weakness further
increases the likelihood of neurologic involvement.
Most cases of back pain are idiopathic, referred to as nonspecific low back pain,
and usually of musculoskeletal origin. In patients with back pain < 4 weeks’ duration
and no associated symptoms, imaging studies and other diagnostic tests are generally
not beneficial. Studies have shown that the history and physical examination can
help separate the majority of patients with simple and self-limited musculoskeletal
back pain from the minority with more serious underlying causes. Most patients
with low back pain have nonserious causes, and the pain will resolve with rest; how-
ever, some conditions can be life threatening. Searching for “red flag” symptoms can

help the clinician use diagnostic tests in a more judicious manner. Major red flag
symptoms include weight loss, fever, young age, constant pain, neurologic symptoms,
history of cancer, injection drug use, and nonmechanical pain. The following section
discusses clinical examples of nonmechanical back pain.
In patients with systemic symptoms who have pain at night or pain that is not
relieved by lying in a supine position, malignancy should be considered. Primary
cancers that commonly metastasize to the spine include lung, breast, prostate, lym-
phoma, and gastrointestinal tumors and melanoma. Multiple myeloma affects the
skeleton diffusely; the spinal compromise frequently manifests as back pain.
Ankylosing spondyloarthritis usually presents in young patients (age < 45); the
back pain improves with activity and can awaken the patient from sleep. Character-
istic x-ray findings include sacroiliitis and “bamboo spine.”
Diskitis, spinal osteomyelitis, and sometimes epidural abscesses present with
fever, constant back pain, and history of intravenous drug use or intravascular cath-
eters (hemodialysis patients). Rapid workup with blood cultures, spinal magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and rapid initiation of antibiotics are indicated. Some
cases require surgery. Table 32–2 describes the recommended workup for some
concerning causes of low back pain.
Clinical Presentation
When the patient has worrisome symptoms or signs, the most effective initial eval-
uation includes plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the involved area
Table 32–2 • RECOMMENDED WORKUP IN PATIENTS WITH LOWER
BACK PAIN
Cancer • Consider multiple myeloma or bony metastasis from
prostate, lung, or breast cancer
• Obtain CBC, ESR, C-reactive protein, and MRI
Compression fracture • Consider this in patients with osteoporosis, steroid use,
or the elderly
• Obtain an x-ray
Ankylosing spondyloarthritis • Consider in patients with inflammatory symptoms, younger
patients, and those with early morning pain
• Obtain an x-ray
Radicular pain • Consider in patients with symptoms in the L4, L5,
or S1 distribution
• Obtain imaging in patients eligible for surgery
Infection • Consider in patients with accompanying fever, those
with a history of intravenous drug use, and those with
persistent pain
• Obtain MRI, CBC, CMP, and blood cultures
Spinal canal stenosis • Consider in patients with accompanying buttock pain,
claudication (neurogenic), and older age
• Obtain MRI in patients eligible for surgery

of the spine, a sedimentation rate test, and a complete blood count (CBC). More
advanced imaging, such as MRI, should be reserved for those patients for whom
surgery is being considered (concerning neurologic symptoms, without surgical
contraindications). Imaging studies often have abnormal findings, even in patients
without low back pain, making it difficult to correlate symptoms with imaging
findings.
During the physical examination, palpable point tenderness over the spinous
processes may indicate a destructive lesion of the spine itself; in contrast, those
with musculoskeletal back pain most often have tenderness in the muscular para-
spinal area. Strength, sensation, and reflexes should be assessed, especially in
those with complaints of radicular or radiating pain. Straight leg raise testing, in
which the examiner holds the patient’s ankle and passively elevates the patient’s
leg to 45 degrees, is helpful if it elicits pain in the lower back, suggesting nerve
root compression. However, it is not a very sensitive or specific test. The Patrick
maneuver, also known as a flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) test, can
help distinguish pain emanating from the sacroiliac joint. In this test, the patient
externally rotates the hip, flexes the knee, and crosses the knee of the other leg
with the ankle (like a number 4) while the examiner simultaneously presses down
on the flexed knee and the opposite side of the pelvis. Pain produced anteriorly on
the flexed side suggests a hip disorder, while contralateral posterior pain suggests
sacroiliac pathology.
Treatment
In treating idiopathic low back pain, various modalities have been shown to be
equally effective in the long run. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that
encouraging the patient to continue his or her usual activity is superior to recom-
mendations for bed rest. Therefore, patients without disability and without evi-
dence of nerve root compression probably can maintain judicious activity. Bed rest
probably is appropriate only for individuals with severe pain or neurologic deficits.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (on a scheduled rather than on an
as-needed basis), nonaspirin analgesics, and muscle relaxants may help in the acute
phase. Because most cases of disk herniation with radiculopathy resolve spontane-
ously within 4 to 6 weeks without surgery, conservative measures are the initial
regimen recommended for these patients as well. Narcotic analgesics may be an
option in cases of very severe pain; however, because idiopathic low back pain is
often a chronic problem, prolonged narcotic use beyond the initial phase is highly
discouraged. Chiropractic therapy, physical therapy, massage therapy, and acupunc-
ture have been studied in trials of varying quality, with results comparable to tradi-
tional approaches. Referral to a surgeon may be considered for those patients with
radicular pain, with or without neuropathy, that does not resolve with 4 to 6 weeks
of conservative management.
Patients with concerning clinical features, such as a history of malignancy, fever,
or examination findings suggestive of spinal cord compression or cauda equina syn-
drome, should be referred for urgent imaging, either MRI or computed tomogra-
phy of the spine, to evaluate for conditions such as vertebral metastases, vertebral
osteomyelitis, or spinal epidural abscesses that require urgent treatment.

32.4 A 45-year-old man presents to the office for lower back pain of 2 weeks’ dura-
tion related to a motor vehicle collision. After the collision, he did not initially
seek medical care and took acetaminophen over the counter. However, for the
past day, he has complained of decreased sensation in his buttock area, prob-
lems voiding (urine dribbling), and inability to achieve an erection. On exam-
ination, he has decreased anal sphincter tone and decreased ankle reflexes
bilaterally. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A. Bed rest and follow-up in 4 to 6 weeks
B. Plain film x-ray of lumbosacral spine
C. Determination of sedimentation rate and CBC
D. Immediate referral for advanced imaging and surgical evaluation
ANSWERS
32.1 A. This is a patient who has no red flag signs of back pain and class 2 obe-
sity (severe obesity with BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2). Regular (scheduled) doses of
NSAIDs and resuming activity as normal (as tolerated) are the recommended
therapy. Bed rest (answer B) has not been shown to improve outcomes in
idiopathic low back pain compared to encouraging mild-to-moderate activity,
and it increases the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Imaging (answers C and D)
is not necessary with uncomplicated back pain.
32.2 B. The patient’s country of origin, the chronic and slowly progressive nature
of the pain in association with fever, and night sweats are highly suggestive of
tuberculous osteomyelitis of the spine or Pott disease. Bacterial osteomyelitis
(answer A) presents more acutely, often with high, spiking fevers. Metastatic
breast cancer (answer D) and multiple myeloma (answer E) are extremely
rare in this age group. The fevers, night sweats, and persistent and progressive
nature of her back pain make a musculoskeletal cause (answer C) unlikely.
32.3 C. This patient likely has multiple myeloma. She has many “red flag” symp-
toms in her presentation: her age, new-onset pain, and history of weight loss.
The markedly elevated ESR suggests an inflammatory condition or situation
with high levels of proteins (in this case, immunoglobulins). The elevated
calcium level and mild renal failure are also suggestive of multiple myeloma.
Plain radiographs of the axial and appendicular skeleton may illustrate the
lytic bone lesions often seen in this disease. Because the lesions are purely
osteolytic, serum levels of alkaline phosphatase are normal, and bone scans
do not detect them. Osteoporosis and compression fractures (answer A) are
common in postmenopausal women but they are either asymptomatic or lead
to some localized pain of the spine; the other red flags such as fever, trauma,
urinary dysfunction, and saddle anesthesia are not present. Answer B (renal
failure with osteodystrophy) can occur due to secondary hyperparathyroid-
ism; this occurs due to decreased levels of vitamin D and, thus, decreased
calcium absorption. The elevated ESR and weight loss do not occur with
this condition; also, this patient’s creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL is not high
33_Toy-IM_Case32_p331-340.indd 338 25/08/20 9:29 AM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,366,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 339
enough to suggest this etiology. Answer D (lumbar strain) is not associated
with an elevated ESR or weigh loss; also, the patient should recall the injury.
Answer E (osteomyelitis) usually manifests as fever and can elevate the ESR,
but usually there is point tenderness at the site of infection.
32.4 D. Most patients with lower back pain have self-limited symptoms and
improve with conservative measures. However, some red flag conditions are
important to monitor. This patient, for instance, has bladder and buttocks
sensory dysfunction and erectile dysfunction, which are highly suggestive of
cauda equina syndrome. Immediate assessment by MRI or myelography and
prompt surgical decompression should be accomplished to avoid long-term
nerve denervation and incontinence/lower extremity weakness. Answers A
(bed rest and follow-up in 4-6 weeks), B (x-ray of lumbosacral spine), and C
(sedimentation rate and CBC) all delay treatment.

A 48-year-old man comes to your office complaining of severe right knee pain
for 8 hours. He states that the pain started abruptly at 2 am and woke him from
his sleep. The pain is so severe that even the weight of the bed sheets on his
knee was unbearable. By the morning, the knee had become warm, swollen, and
tender. He prefers to keep his knee bent since straightening the knee causes the
pain to worsen. He has never had pain, surgery, or injury to his knees. A year ago,
he did have some pain and swelling at the base of his great toe on the left foot,
which was not as severe as this episode, and the previous pain resolved in 2 or
3 days after taking ibuprofen. His only medical history is hypertension, which is
controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. He is a nonsmoker and reports moderate
social alcohol use.
On examination, his temperature is 99.4 °F, heart rate is 104 beats per minute
(bpm), blood pressure (BP) is 136/78 mm Hg, weight is 212 lb, and height is 5’11”. His
head and neck examinations are unremarkable, his chest is clear to auscultation,
and his heart is tachycardic but regular, with no gallops or murmurs. His right knee
is swollen, with a moderate effusion, and appears erythematous, warm, and very
tender to palpation. He is unable to fully extend the knee because of pain. He has
no other joint swelling, pain, or deformity and no skin rashes.

ANSWERS TO CASE 33:
Acute Monoarticular Arthritis—Gout
Summary: A 48-year-old man presents with
Acute onset of severe right knee pain

Swollen, erythematous right knee with effusion and limited range of motion that is

tender to palpation
No previous surgery or injury to his knees

Previous episode of pain and swelling at the base of his great toe that resolved with

ibuprofen
History of hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide

Most likely diagnosis: Acute monoarticular arthritis, likely crystalline or infectious.
Most likely to be gout due to history of pain in the great toe and hydrochlorothia-
zide use.
Next step: Aspiration of the knee joint to send fluid for cell count, culture, and
crystal analysis.
Best initial treatment: If the joint fluid analysis is consistent with infection, he needs
drainage of the infected fluid by aspiration and administration of antibiotics. If
analysis is suggestive of crystal-induced arthritis, he can be treated with colchicine,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or corticosteroids.
Most important risk factors: Hyperuricemia (obesity, idiopathic, renal failure, thia-
zide diuretics, tumor lysis syndrome).
Most effective prevention: Diet modification, allopurinol, febuxostat.
ANALYSIS

1. Differentiate synovial fluid features to determine the etiology of arthritis.

2. Describe the stages of gout and the appropriate treatment for each stage.

3. Describe the similarities and differences between different types of crystalline
arthritis. (EPA 2)
Considerations
A middle-aged man presents with an acute attack of monoarticular arthritis, as
evidenced by knee effusion, limited range of motion, and signs of inflammation
(low-grade fever, erythema, warmth, tenderness). The two most likely causes are
infection (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) and crystalline arthritis. If the patient is at risk,
gonococcal arthritis is also a possibility. The previous less severe episode involving
34_Toy-IM_Case33_p341-352.indd 342 24/08/20 2:52 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,370,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 343
his first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint sounds like podagra, the most common
presentation of gout. The rapid onset of severe symptoms during the current attack
is consistent with acute gouty arthritis. In this patient, the attack could have been
precipitated by the use of alcohol, which increases uric acid production, and his use
of thiazide diuretics, which decrease renal excretion of uric acid.
Although the first attack was typical of gout, which makes this episode very
likely to also be acute gouty arthritis, the current presentation could also be consis-
tent with bacterial infection. Untreated septic arthritis could lead to rapid destruc-
tion of the joint, so joint aspiration and empiric antibiotic therapy are appropriate
until his cultures and crystal analysis are available.
APPROACH TO:
Monoarticular Arthritis
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE (CPP) CRYSTAL ARTHRITIS:
Arthritis caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crys-
tals. Previously known as “pseudogout.”
GOUT: A disturbance of uric acid metabolism occurring mainly in men, charac-
terized by hyperuricemia and the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the
joints and connective tissue.
MONOARTHRITIS: Inflammation of a single joint.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Almost any joint disorder may begin as monoarthritis; however, the primary con-
cern is always infectious arthritis because it may lead to joint destruction and resul-
tant severe morbidity. For that reason, acute monoarthritis should be considered a
medical emergency and investigated and treated aggressively.
Accurate diagnosis starts with a good history and physical examination sup-
plemented by additional diagnostic testing, such as synovial fluid analysis, radi-
ography, and occasionally synovial biopsy. Patients with crystal-induced arthritis
may give a history of recurrent, self-limited episodes. Precipitation of an attack
by surgery or some other stress can occur with both crystalline disorders, but
gout is far more common than acute CPP crystal arthritis. The clinical course
can provide some clues to the etiology: Septic arthritis usually worsens unless
treated; osteoarthritis worsens with physical activity. Gout classically progresses
through four stages (Table 33–1). Interestingly, the presence of completely
asymptomatic periods (intercritical gout) between monoarthritic attacks is so
uncommon, except in crystalline arthritis, that it is often used as a diagnostic
criterion for gout.

Clinical Presentation
History and Physical Examination. Affected patients complain of the spontane-
ous onset of severe pain, edema, and redness of the joint. There is often a family
history. Triggers can include dietary consumption of high purine foods, dehy-
dration, or medications that increase uric acid levels.
Gout most commonly involves the first MTP joint (podagra), ankle, midfoot, or
knee. Acute CPP crystal arthritis most commonly affects the large joints, such as
the knee; it may also affect the wrist or the first MTP joint. In gonococcal arthritis,
there are often migratory arthralgias and tenosynovitis, often involving the wrist and
hands, associated with pustular skin lesions. These may progress to purulent mono-
arthritis or oligoarthritis. Nongonococcal causes of septic arthritis often involve
large weight-bearing joints, such as the knee and hip. The most common bacterial
pathogen comes from skin flora, such as S. aureus.
The basic approach in physical examination is to differentiate arthritis from
inflammatory conditions adjacent to the joint, such as cellulitis or bursitis. True
arthritis is characterized by swelling and redness around the joint and painful limita-
tion of motion in all planes during active and passive motion. Joint movement that is
34_Toy-IM_Case33_p341-352.indd 344 24/08/20 2:52 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,372,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 345
not limited by passive motion suggests a soft tissue disorder such as bursitis rather
than arthritis.
Laboratory Tests/Imaging. Synovial fluid analysis helps to differentiate between
inflammatory and noninflammatory causes of arthritis. Diagnostic arthrocentesis is
usually necessary when evaluating an acute monoarthritis and is essential when infec-
tion is suspected. Fluid analysis typically includes gross examination, cell count and
differential, Gram stain and culture, and crystal analysis. Figure 33–1 shows the
typical results that can help one distinguish between noninflammatory conditions
such as osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis such as crystalline disease, and septic
arthritis, which is most often a bacterial infection.
Normal joints contain a small amount of fluid that is essentially acellular. Non-
inflammatory effusions should have a white blood cell (WBC) count less than 1000
to 2000/mm3 with less than 25% to 50% polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. If the
fluid is inflammatory, the joint should be considered infected until proven otherwise,
especially if the patient is febrile.
Crystal analysis requires the use of a polarizing light microscope. Monosodium
urate crystals, the cause of gout, are needle shaped, typically intracellular within a
PMN cell, and are negatively birefringent, appearing yellow under the polarizing
microscope as seen in Figure 33–2. CPPD crystals, the cause of acute CPP crystal-
line arthritis, are short and rhomboid and are weakly positively birefringent, appear-
ing blue under polarized light. Even if crystals are seen, infection must be excluded
when the synovial fluid is inflammatory. Crystals and infection may coexist in the
same joint, and chronic arthritis or previous joint damage, such as occurs in gout,
may predispose that joint to hematogenous infection.
In septic arthritis, Gram stain and culture of the synovial fluid is positive in
60% to 80% of cases. False-negative results may be related to prior antibiotic use
or fastidious microorganisms. For example, in gonococcal arthritis, joint fluid cul-
tures typically are negative, whereas cultures of blood or the pustular skin lesions may
be positive. Sometimes the diagnosis rests on demonstration of gonococcal infec-
tion in another site, such as urethritis, with the typical arthritis-dermatitis syn-
drome. Synovial biopsy may be required when the cause of monoarthritis remains
unclear, and it is usually necessary to diagnose arthritis caused by tuberculosis or
hemochromatosis.
Plain radiographs usually are unremarkable in cases of inflammatory arthritis;
the typical finding is soft tissue swelling. Chondrocalcinosis or linear calcium depo-
sition in joint cartilage as seen in Figure 33–3 suggests acute CPP arthritis.
Treatment
Generally, patients require initiation of treatment before all test results are avail-
able. When septic arthritis is suspected, the clinician should culture the joint
fluid and start antibiotic therapy; the antibiotic choice should be initially based
on the Gram stain and, when available, the culture results. If the Gram stain is
negative, the clinical picture should dictate antimicrobial selection. For example,
if the patient has the typical presentation of gonococcal arthritis, intravenous cef-
triaxone is the usual initial therapy, usually with rapid improvement in symptoms.
Nongonococcal septic arthritis usually is caused by gram-positive organisms,

most often S. aureus, so treatment would involve an antistaphylococcal antibiotic
such as vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid. If cultures demonstrate organisms
that are sensitive to beta-lactams, antibiotic therapy can be guided by the cul-
ture and susceptibility results. It is essential to drain the purulent joint fluid, usu-
ally by repeated percutaneous aspiration. Open surgical drainage or arthroscopy
is required when joint fluid is loculated or when shoulders, hips, or sacroiliac
joints are involved.
In general, asymptomatic hyperuricemia requires no specific treatment. Lowering
the urate level does not necessarily prevent the development of gout, and most of
these patients will never develop any symptoms.
In patients with symptomatic hyperuricemia (patients who have uric acid kid-
ney stones, more than two acute gout attacks per year, or tophi), recommended
treatment is with urate-lowering therapy, which is discussed in the material that
follows. Acute gouty arthritis is treated with therapies to reduce the inflammatory
reaction to the presence of the crystals, all of which are most effective if started
early in the attack. Potent NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, are the mainstay of ther-
apy during an acute attack. Alternatively, oral colchicine can be taken three times
daily until the joint symptoms abate, but dosing is limited by gastrointestinal side
effects such as nausea and diarrhea. For individuals affected by acute joint pain
with renal insufficiency (for which an NSAID or colchicine is relatively contraindi-
cated), intra-articular glucocorticoid injection or oral steroid therapy is usually ben-
eficial. Steroids should be used only if infection has been excluded. Treatment to
lower uric acid levels is inappropriate during an acute episode because any sudden
increase or decrease in urate levels may precipitate further attacks.
Patients with tophaceous gout are managed as previously described during acute
attacks and subsequently treated with allopurinol to help tophaceous deposits
resolve. A new agent, pegloticase, is an intravenous medication that is a recombi-
nant form of urate-oxidase enzyme that will rapidly dissolve tophi in patients with
treatment-resistant tophaceous gout. Surgery may be indicated if the mass effect
of tophi causes nerve compression, joint deformity, or chronic skin ulceration with
resultant infection.
Prognosis and Prevention. During intercritical gout, the focus shifts to preventing
further attacks by lowering uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL. Dietary restriction is
mainly aimed at avoiding organ-rich foods, such as liver, and alcohol. Patients tak-
ing thiazide diuretics should be switched to another antihypertensive if possible.
Urate lowering can be accomplished by therapy to increase uric acid excretion by
the kidney, such as with probenecid. Uricosuric agents such as probenecid are inef-
fective in patients with renal failure, however, and are contraindicated in patients
with a history of uric acid kidney stones. In these patients, allopurinol can be used
to diminish uric acid production, but it must be given at a lower dose in patients
with renal disease. Febuxostat is a new xanthine oxidase inhibitor that does not
require dose adjustment in renal insufficiency.
Patients with acute CPP arthritis are treated similarly for acute attacks
(NSAIDs, colchicine, and systemic or intra-articular steroids). Prophylaxis with
colchicine may be helpful in patients with chronic recurrent attacks, but there is no
effective therapy for preventing CPPD crystal formation or deposition.

ANSWERS
33.1 E. The patient described best fits the picture of disseminated gonococcal
infection. She has the corresponding pustular rash, which typically is located
on extensor surfaces of distal extremities. Pain on passive flexion of her wrist
indicates likely tenosynovitis of that area. The fluid is inflammatory (high
number of leukocytes), but gonococci are typically not seen on Gram stain;
if they are seen, they are gram-negative intracellular diplococci. Intravenous
ceftriaxone is the usual treatment of choice for gonococcal infection and
because of the possibility of resistance, oral zithromycin is added. Treatment
is usually at least for 1 week. Gonococcal arthritis is the most common cause
of infectious arthritis in patients younger than 40 years. Nafcillin (answer B)
would be useful for staphylococcal arthritis and would be the more likely
choice if she were older, had some chronic joint disease such as rheumatoid
arthritis, or were immunocompromised. Indomethacin (answer A) or colchi-
cine (answer C) would be useful if she had a crystalline arthritis, but that is
unlikely in this clinical picture. Intra-articular prednisone (answer D) is
contraindicated until infectious arthritis is ruled out.
33.2 D. Synovial fluid analysis and cultures (answers A and B) usually are sterile
in gonococcal arthritis (in fact, the arthritis is more likely caused by immune
complex deposition than by actual joint infection), and blood cultures
(answer C) are positive less than 50% of the time. Diagnosis is more often
made by finding gonococcal infection through nucleic acid amplification tests
in a more typical site, such as the urethra, cervix, or pharynx.
33.3 C. This patient presents with an acute inflammatory arthritis, which should
be treated as possible a septic arthritis until final cultures return. The inflam-
matory arthritis as shown by markedly elevated leukocyte count in the syno-
vial fluid. The Gram stain of the joint aspirate is suspicious for infection,
even with no organisms seen on Gram stain. In other words, the sensitivity
of Gram stain for a septic arthritis is low; however, the positive predictive
value if organisms are present is high. Although the presence of crystals may
suggest a crystalline arthritis, it does not eliminate the possibility of a con-
current infection. Typically, crystalline arthritis is associated with a synovial
white cell count in the range of 5000 to 40,000/mm3, and the typical cell
count for infectious arthritis is > 50,000 cells/mm3. These are general tenden-
cies and not hard and fast rules. Importantly, if intravenous antibiotics are not
administered in the setting of a septic joint, then the patient may lose func-
tion of the joint or even die. Thus, antibiotics should be administered to this
patient until infection is ruled out. Corticosteroids—either oral (answer A)
or intra-articular (answer B)—should not be used until infection is ruled out.
Answer D (colchicine) can be given for pseudogout but is not as important as
antibiotics. NSAIDs, rest, ice, and pain control should be instituted in addi-
tion to intravenous antibiotics. Synovial cultures should return in 48 hours.

CLINICAL PEARLS
In the absence of trauma, acute monoarthritis is most likely to be caused
»
by septic or crystalline arthritis.
In a febrile patient with a joint effusion, diagnostic arthrocentesis is man-
»
datory. Inflammatory fluid (WBC count more than 2000/mm3) should be
considered infected until proven otherwise.
Gonococcal arthritis usually presents as a migratory tenosynovitis, often

involving the wrists and hands, with few vesiculopustular skin lesions.
Nongonococcal septic arthritis is most often caused by S. aureus and

most often affects large weight-bearing joints.
Monosodium urate crystals in gout are needle shaped and negatively

birefringent (yellow) under the polarizing microscope. CPPD crystals in
pseudogout are rhomboid and positively birefringent (blue).
Treatment of gout depends on the stage: NSAIDs (specifically indo-

methacin), colchicine, or steroids for an acute gouty arthritis, and urate-
lowering therapy with probenecid, allopurinol, or febuxostat during the
intercritical period.

A 32-year-old nurse presents to your office with a complaint of intermittent
episodes of pain, stiffness, and swelling in both hands and wrists for approximately
1 year. The episodes last for several weeks and then resolve. More recently, she
noticed similar symptoms in her knees and ankles. Joint pain and stiffness are
making it harder for her to get out of bed in the morning and are interfering with
her ability to perform her duties at work. The joint stiffness usually lasts for several
hours before improving. She also reports malaise and easy fatigability for the past
few months, but she denies having fever, chills, skin rashes, and weight loss.
Physical examination reveals a well-developed woman, with blood pressure
120/70 mm Hg, heart rate 82 beats per minute (bpm), and respiratory rate
14 breaths per minute. Her skin does not reveal any rashes. Head, neck,
cardiovascular, chest, and abdominal examinations are normal. There is no
hepatosplenomegaly. The joint examination reveals the presence of bilateral
swelling, redness, and tenderness of the most proximal interphalangeal (PIP)
joints, metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints, the wrists, and the knees. Laboratory
studies show a mild anemia with hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 32.5%, mean
corpuscular volume 85.7 fL, white blood cell count 7900/mm3 with a normal
differential, and platelet count 300,000/mm3. The urinalysis is clear with no protein

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Differentiate the clinical presentation of RA from other symmetric polyarthri-
tis syndromes. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Describe the clinical course of RA. (EPA 1, 12)
3. Review the different treatment options for RA. (EPA 4, 7, 9)
Considerations
This patient’s history, including the symmetric peripheral polyarthritis and dura-
tion of symptoms, is suggestive of RA. RA is a systemic autoimmune disorder of
unknown etiology. Its major distinctive feature is a chronic, symmetric, and erosive
synovitis of peripheral joints, which, if untreated, leads to deformity and destruc-
tion of joints due to erosion of cartilage and bone. The MP joints of the hands
are often affected, and ulnar deviation of the fingers is a common finding. The
diagnosis of RA is a clinical one, based on the presence of a combination of clinical
findings, laboratory abnormalities, and, in later stages, if untreated, radiographic
erosions.

APPROACH TO:
Polyarticular Arthritis
DEFINITIONS
ANTI-CCP (CYCLIC CITRULLINATED PEPTIDE) ANTIBODIES: Autoanti-
bodies that are found early in RA and have greater specificity than RF.
POLYARTHRITIS: Inflammation of five or more joints.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Clinical Findings
The first and most important step in evaluating a patient with polyarticular joint
pain is determining whether or not synovitis/arthritis is present, producing soft tis-
sue swelling, joint effusion, tenderness, warmth of the joint, and limitation of both
active and passive range of motion. If the only finding is pain without inflamma-
tory changes, then the diagnostic considerations include noninflammatory diseases
such as osteoarthritis (OA), fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain, and
depression. The presence of soft tissue swelling and tenderness with limited active
range of motion but normal passive range of motion suggests the problem is extra-
articular soft tissue inflammation, such as bursitis or tendonitis.
If there is active synovitis/arthritis, it is clinically useful to distinguish between
monoarticular/oligoarticular arthritis and polyarticular arthritis. In polyarticular
disease, the next diagnostic clue is the duration of symptoms. If symptoms are rela-
tively acute (< 6 weeks), the major considerations are arthritis due to viral infection
(such as hepatitis B or C, rubella, or parvovirus B19) or the earliest manifesta-
tion of a true rheumatic disease. Viral serologies and compatible clinical history of
exposure often can make the diagnosis at this point and obviate need for further
rheumatologic evaluation. Treatment of a viral arthritis usually is limited to symp-
tom relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because the con-
ditions are generally self-limited.
Differential Diagnosis
Symmetric peripheral polyarthritis is the most characteristic feature of RA. It can
also be seen in other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus ery-
thematosus and psoriatic arthritis. Lupus, which may present with a symmetric
polyarthritis, usually is characterized by the presence of other symptoms, such as
malar rash, serositis (pleuritis and pericarditis), renal disease with proteinuria or
hematuria, central nervous system manifestations, and hematologic disorders, such
as hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Rheumatic
fever, which can cause symmetric polyarthritis, is an acute febrile illness lasting only
6 to 8 weeks. In psoriatic arthritis, the pattern of joint involvement varies widely.
The vast majority of patients have peripheral joint involvement of more than five
joints. Others have a pauciarticular asymmetric arthritis or exclusive distal inter-
phalangeal (DIP) involvement. Inflammation is not limited to the joints but also
35_Toy-IM_Case34_p353-362.indd 355 03/09/20 7:00 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,383,"356 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
occurs at the periosteum, along tendons, and at the insertion points into the bone,
resulting in the development of dactylitis or “sausage digits,” which are typical of pso-
riatic arthritis and reactive arthritis. Although the arthritis can precede the devel-
opment of a skin rash, the definite diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis cannot be made
without the evidence of skin or nail changes typical of psoriasis (nail pitting, scaly
plaques). Reactive arthritis is an asymmetric inflammatory arthritis that follows
infection of the gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary tract with bacteria such as
Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, or Chlamydia. Reactive arthritis can
present with the triad of arthritis, uveitis, and urethritis.
The peripheral polyarthritis of RA most typically involves the wrists, MTP
joints of the feet, and the MP or PIP joints of both hands; the DIP joints usu-
ally are spared. It is useful to contrast the typical pattern of joint involvement of
RA with that of degenerative OA. Degenerative joint disease may affect multiple
joints, but it occurs in older age groups, is usually not associated with inflamma-
tion or constitutional symptoms, and tends not to be episodic. Also, in OA the
hand joints most commonly involved are the DIP joints, where the formation of
Heberden nodes can be noted (Figure 34–1). In RA, ulnar deviation of the MP
joints is often associated with radial deviation of the wrists; swan-neck deformities
as well as the boutonnière deformity can develop (Figure 34–2). Swan-neck defor-
mity results from contracture of the interosseous and flexor muscles and tendons,
which causes a flexion contracture of the MP joint, hyperextension of the PIP
joint, and flexion of the DIP joint. In the boutonnière deformity, there is a flexion
of the PIP and hyperextension of the DIP joints. These findings are typical of
advanced RA.
Clinical Presentation
Morning stiffness or stiffness after any prolonged inactivity is a common feature
of many arthritic disorders. However, stiffness that lasts more than 1 hour is
seen only in inflammatory conditions such as RA and reflects the severity of joint
inflammation.
Rheumatoid nodules are subcutaneous nodules typically found over extensor
surfaces of the proximal ulna or other pressure points. They only occur in 20% to
30% of patients with RA but are believed to have a high diagnostic specificity for
RA.
RFs are immunoglobulins (Ig’s) that react to the F portion of IgG molecules. The
C
usual serologic tests used in clinical laboratories detect immunoglobulin M (IgM)
RFs, which are found in 80% to 85% of patients with RA. RF is not specific for RA,
as it is found in 5% of healthy patients, but it can support the diagnosis when clini-
cal features are suggestive. High RF titers have a prognostic utility for more severe
systemic and progressive disease.
Antibodies to anti-CCP are now recognized as very useful biomarkers with diag-
nostic and prognostic significance. Anti-CCP antibodies have the same sensitivity
as RF but are highly specific, about 95%. The presence of anti-CCP also portends
worse outcomes in RA. Current classification criteria for the diagnosis of RA are
listed in Table 34–1.

Radiologic findings in RA, such as erosion of periarticular bone and cartilage
destruction with loss of joint space, may support the diagnosis. Usually, though,
the typical x-ray findings do not develop until later in the disease process after a
diagnosis has been made based on clinical findings. Joint deformities in RA occur
from several different mechanisms, all related to synovitis and pannus formation

involvement, ocular manifestations with symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca
(Sjögren syndrome), respiratory manifestations caused by interstitial lung disease,
cardiac manifestations, and several neurologic manifestations, such as myelopathy,
related to cervical spine instability. Although not common, the continuous bone
erosion may result in an atlantoaxial subluxation with cervical dislocation and spi-
nal cord compression. Entrapment neuropathy may develop, such as carpal tunnel
syndrome. Hematologic manifestations include anemia, typically anemia of chronic
disease. The combination of RA, splenomegaly, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, and
thrombocytopenia is called Felty syndrome. Felty syndrome is most common with
severe nodule-forming RA.
At this stage in the disease process, our patient is presenting with joint com-
plaints, fatigue, and malaise. No other extra-articular manifestations have devel-
oped yet. At the very onset of RA, the characteristic symmetric inflammation of
the joints and the typical serologic findings may not be evident. Therefore, initially
distinguishing RA from other conditions, such as lupus, may be difficult. Usually,
the development of extra-articular phenomena allows the clinician to make a more
specific diagnosis.
Treatment
Several drugs are currently used for treatment of RA. NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase
2 (COX-2) inhibitors such as celecoxib may control local inflammatory symptoms
but do not treat the underlying disease. Corticosteroids have an immediate and
dramatic effect on joint symptoms but were historically thought not to alter the
natural progression of the disease. Recent evidence suggests that low-dose cortico-
steroids may retard the progression of bone erosions.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may have a favorable impact
on the natural course of the disease, reducing joint inflammation and disease activ-
ity and slowing or preventing the structural progression of RA. The nonbiologic
DMARDs include methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, minocycline,
and leflunomide. There is controversy regarding which DMARD is the most effec-
tive, but methotrexate is often used as the first drug of choice because of its rapid
onset of action and higher tolerability and patient compliance. Toxicity of the vari-
ous DMARDs is often the most important determinant of which drug is used, and
if the patient fails to respond or develops unacceptable side effects, the patient may
be tried on a different agent.
In the last decade, the biologic DMARDs have revolutionized the treat-
ment of RA. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (etanercept, infliximab, adali-
mumab, golimumab, and certolizumab) have been found to reduce disease activity
within weeks, unlike other DMARDs, which may take several months to act. TNF
antagonists may also control signs and symptoms that have failed to respond to con-
ventional DMARD therapy. Side effects of TNF blockers may include increased risk
of infection, such as reactivation tuberculosis (TB), so all patients should first be
screened for latent TB. Other biologics currently in use include anakinra, a recom-
binant interleukin (IL) 1 receptor antagonist; abatacept, a soluble fusion protein of
IgG and human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4); rituximab, a
chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, a cell-surface molecule of B lymphocytes;

34.4 A 36-year-old woman is being seen by her physician in the office due to pain
in her hands, wrists, and knees that has progressed over the past 6 months.
She has tried over-the-counter ibuprofen without relief. Based on the dis-
tribution of the joint involvement, she is diagnosed with RA. Which of the
following treatments will reduce joint inflammation and slow progression of
this patient’s disease?
A. NSAIDs
B. Joint aspiration
C. Methotrexate
D. Systemic corticosteroids
ANSWERS
34.1 A. Parvovirus presents with a symmetric arthritis in the small joints of the
hands that resembles RA. In adults who contract the virus, the arthritis is
usually self-limiting. Children with parvovirus usually present with a rash on
the face and often have no arthritis. The patient is young for OA (answer B),
and the wrong joints (usually the DIP and PIP joints of the hands in OA) are
affected. She does not describe widespread pain, which would be a feature of
fibromyalgia syndrome (answer C). In addition, she has some systemic fea-
tures, such as anemia, and she has not had GI symptoms suggestive of celiac
disease (answer D). Celiac disease can be associated with arthritis as well that
might mimic RA.
34.2 C. Marginal erosions, periarticular osteopenia, and uniform joint space nar-
rowing are classic for RA. Pencil-in-cup radiographic changes (answer A) are
seen in psoriatic arthritis. Osteophyte formation (answer B) is seen in OA,
and syndesmophytes (answer D) are seen in ankylosing spondyloarthritis.
34.3 D. Acid fast studies should be obtained to assess for tuberculosis. This
patient has been on treatment with an anti-TNF inhibitor, adalimumab, and
has developed a cough and fever for 3 months. Therefore, it is possible the
patient has reactivated TB, a known complication of the drug. Parvovirus
(answer A) and acute hepatitis C (answer B) are not associated with a cough.
The duration of symptoms is likely too long for influenza (answer C), mak-
ing screening for TB the best choice. It is also important to remember that
there are still active cases of TB in the United States, and one does not have
to travel to contract TB.
34.4 C. Although NSAIDs (answer A) and corticosteroids (answer D) may
help to relieve symptoms, they typically do not slow or prevent structural
progression of disease. DMARDs include methotrexate, hydroxychloro-
quine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and biologic agents. Of these agents,
methotrexate is usually the drug of choice and is the anchor drug of most
combination therapies. Joint aspiration (answer B) may relieve the acute
symptoms of inflammation; it also will not slow the natural history of the
disease.

A 57-year-old man is referred to the internal medicine clinic for a right radius/
ulnar fracture that occurred 1 week ago from an incidental contact with the car
door. X-rays showed marked demineralization of the bones. He also has fatigue,
weakness, and a 20-lb weight gain over the last 2 years, particularly around the
abdomen. He has noticed these symptoms for around 3 months. He denies
suffering from any medical condition, although his last visit to a primary care
provider was more than 5 years ago. He reports a 30 pack-year history of cigarette
smoking and denies alcohol or illicit drug consumption. On examination, his blood
pressure is 155/95 mm Hg, pulse rate is 80 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate
is 20 breaths per minute, and temperature is 99 °F. His body mass index (BMI) is
28 kg/m2. His neck, abdomen, and upper back look full, with reddish-purple striae
on his abdomen and thighs. His heart examination shows regular sounds S and S,

ANSWERS TO CASE 35 B:
Osteoporosis, Cushing Syndrome
Summary: A 57-year-old man presents with
A history of heavy smoking

Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and recent fragility fracture

Fatigue, weakness, and weight gain

BMI of 28 kg/m2 (noted to be overweight)

Hypertension, centripetal fat distribution, and reddish-purple striae

Laboratory testing that shows hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated Hb A
 1c
Cause of bony problem: Likely osteoporosis or osteopenia due to high corticoste-
roid levels.
Most likely diagnosis: Cushing syndrome, possibly paraneoplastic.
Next diagnostic step:
Once Cushing syndrome is suspected, one of three tests should be obtained:

24-hour urine-free cortisol (UFC), late-night salivary cortisol, or the low-dose
(1 mg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST).
If any of the above is abnormal, obtain a chest x-ray or contrast-enhanced

computed tomography (CT) of the chest. There is high suspicion for ectopic
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome from a small-cell lung carci-
noma due to the history of heavy smoking, rapid onset of symptoms, and evi-
dence of mineralocorticoid excess (hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic
alkalosis).
Obtain an imaging study of the BMD, such as a dual-energy x-ray absorptiom-

etry (DEXA) test.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the diagnostic approach to suspected Cushing syndrome. (EPA 3)
2. Outline the differential diagnosis for Cushing syndrome. (EPA 2)
3. Identify treatment options for Cushing syndrome. (EPA 4)
4. Describe the criteria to diagnose abnormally low BMD, such as osteopenia and
osteoporosis. (EPA 1, 3)
Considerations
This 57-year-old man presents with a fragility fracture (bone fracture with minor
or no trauma) and radiographic evidence of decreased bone mineralization on x-ray.

Case Files Internal Medicine,392,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 365
He also has many of the stigmata of corticosteroid excess, such as hypertension,
central obesity, abdominal striae, hyperglycemia, and likely buffalo hump. Because
of the smoking history, the Cushing syndrome may be due to a lung cancer secret-
ing ACTH-like hormone (paraneoplastic syndrome), which stimulates the adre-
nal gland to produce excess corticosteroids. Another possibility is that there is an
autonomous tumor (adenoma) of the adrenal cortex producing corticosteroids.
The bony problem is likely due to the high levels of corticosteroids, which is the
most common cause of secondary osteoporosis (not aged related); if the patient
has an underlying lung cancer, bony metastasis to the arm is also possible. Ciga-
rette smoking also predisposes to osteoporosis. The four most important issues
for this patient are (1) suspecting Cushing syndrome based on the history and
physical examination, (2) recommending the initial laboratory tests once Cushing
syndrome is suspected, (3) determining the etiology of the Cushing syndrome, and
(4) understanding other steps in management, including additional diagnostic tests
and treatment options.

Osteoporosis, Cushing Syndrome
DEFINITIONS
ACTH-DEPENDENT CUSHING SYNDROME: Cushing syndrome due to an
ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma or ectopic source.
ACTH-INDEPENDENT CUSHING SYNDROME: Cushing syndrome caused
by an adrenal disorder.
BISPHOSPHONATES: Synthetic carbon phosphate compounds (alendronate,
risedronate, ibandronate) that build bone mass by binding to pyrophosphatase in
bone and by inhibiting osteoclast bone resorption.
CUSHING DISEASE: Cushing syndrome caused by an ACTH-secreting pituitary
adenoma.
CUSHING SYNDROME: The signs and symptoms that develop when the body is
exposed to excess glucocorticoids.
DEXAMETHASONE SUPPRESSION TEST: In normal individuals, supra-
physiologic doses of glucocorticoids suppress the secretion of ACTH and cortisol.
The low-dose (1-mg) DST is one of three tests obtained to confirm a diagnosis
of Cushing syndrome. The high-dose (8-mg) DST is used to confirm the source
of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome (ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma or
ectopic source).
OSTEOPENIA: BMD that is lower than normal and considered to be a precursor
to osteoporosis. Often defined as a BMD T score of between −1 and −2.5.

T score of less than −2.5.
T SCORE: A BMD comparison against young healthy adults (in standard devia-
tions [SDs] from the mean).
CLINICAL APPROACH TO CUSHING SYNDROME
Pathophysiology
Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome, the most common cause, results from glucocorti-
coid treatment of inflammatory conditions. Cushing disease, which results from
an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, is the most common endogenous cause,
accounting for 60% to 70% of cases. Ectopic ACTH syndrome, which comprises
5% to 10% of cases, refers to nonpituitary tumors that secrete ACTH. Most cases
are due to small-cell lung carcinomas or neuroendocrine tumors of the lung, pan-
creas, or thymus. Adrenocortical adenomas, which secrete cortisol, account for
10% to 15% of cases. Other causes of Cushing syndrome include adrenocortical
carcinoma, primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (may occur as part
of Carney complex), bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, and tumors that
secrete corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Long-term excess corticosteroid
exposure (whether endogenous or medications) alters calcium absorption and
directly inhibits osteoblast activity and augments osteoclast activity.
Clinical Presentation
Signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome depend on the degree and duration
of cortisol exposure. Some patients may present with obvious features of cortisol
excess, while others present with subtle findings. While many features of Cush-
ing syndrome are present in the general population (eg, obesity), some features
are more specific for cortisol excess. This includes reddish-purple striae, plethora
(ie, red face), proximal muscle weakness, and unexplained bruising. Other symp-
toms of cortisol excess include menstrual irregularities, decreased libido, and neu-
ropsychiatric manifestations such as depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive
impairment. Associated conditions include hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporo-
sis. On physical examination, the patient may exhibit facial fullness, supraclavicular
or dorsocervical fat pads, thin skin, lower extremity edema, acne, or hirsutism.
Step 1: Confirm the Diagnosis of Cushing Syndrome. Once Cushing syndrome is
suspected, one of three tests should be obtained: 24-hour UFC, late-night salivary
cortisol, or the low-dose (1-mg) overnight DST. Each test has high sensitivity but
lacks ideal specificity, so false-positive results may occur. If the initial diagnostic test
is positive, one of the remaining tests must be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.
24-hour UFC: Two measurements should be obtained due to variability in cor-
tisol secretion. False-positive results may occur with high fluid intake (> 5 L/d)
or conditions associated with hypercortisolism (eg, depression or alcohol depen-
dence). False-negative results may occur in patients with chronic kidney disease.
Excreted urine cortisol levels begin to decrease with a creatinine clearance less
36_Toy-IM_Case35_p363-376.indd 366 24/08/20 3:00 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,394,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 367
than 60 mL/min and decrease markedly with a creatinine clearance less than
20 mL/min.
Late-night salivary cortisol: In healthy individuals, cortisol levels peak in the
morning (7-9 am) and fall to very low levels during sleep. Patients with Cushing
syndrome typically lose this normal circadian rhythm. Salivary cortisol should be
measured between 11 pm and midnight, and like UFC, two measurements should
be obtained due to variability in cortisol secretion. False-positive results may occur
in patients who use tobacco, as tobacco contains 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydro-
genase type 2 inhibitor glycyrrhizic acid, which inhibits the conversion of cortisol
to inactive cortisone. Late-night salivary cortisol may not be appropriate for shift
workers or patients with variable sleep patterns.
The low-dose (1-mg) DST: In normal individuals, supraphysiologic doses of glu-
cocorticoids suppress the secretion of ACTH and cortisol. For the low-dose DST,
the patient takes 1 mg of dexamethasone between 11 pm and midnight. Cortisol
is measured the following morning at 8 am. The Endocrine Society recommends
using a diagnostic cutoff value of 1.8 µg/dL to maximize sensitivity (greater than
95%). Using this cutoff, the specificity is 80%, yielding a high false-positive rate.
False-positive results may occur in women taking oral contraceptive pills, which
increase cortisol-binding globulin, leading to higher serum cortisol levels. In addi-
tion, false-positive results may occur in patients taking medications (eg, itracon-
azole, ritonavir) that decrease clearance of dexamethasone by inhibiting CYP
(cytochrome P450) 34A. False-negative results may occur in patients taking medi-
cations (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) that accelerate the metabolism of
dexamethasone by inducing CYP 34A.
Step 2: Determine the Etiology (ACTH-Independent vs ACTH-Dependent Cushing
Syndrome). After a diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is confirmed, plasma ACTH
should be measured to determine the etiology.
ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome: A suppressed ACTH level (< 10 pg/mL)
indicates the presence of an adrenal disorder (eg, adrenal adenoma or adrenal carci-
noma). CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the adrenal glands should be
obtained to determine the type of adrenal lesion.
ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome: A normal or elevated ACTH level
(> 10 pg/mL) indicates the presence of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma
(Cushing disease) or ectopic ACTH secretion. Since the majority (80%) of cases
are due to Cushing disease, a pituitary-protocol MRI is typically performed as the
next diagnostic test. If there is high clinical suspicion for ectopic ACTH secretion,
CT or MRI of the neck, chest, or abdomen/pelvis may be obtained to identify the
causal tumor. Although there is overlap in ACTH levels and clinical presentation,
patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome typically present with more severe hyper-
cortisolism and evidence of mineralocorticoid excess (eg, hypertension, hypokale-
mia, metabolic alkalosis, or edema).
Step 3: Confirm the Source of ACTH-Dependent Cushing Syndrome. It is often chal-
lenging to localize an ACTH-secreting microadenoma on MRI. An adenoma is
identified on imaging in only 60% of patients with Cushing disease. A normal MRI
does not exclude a diagnosis of Cushing disease. Small pituitary lesions (≤ 6 mm)
occur in 10% of the general population, so the presence of a pituitary abnormality
36_Toy-IM_Case35_p363-376.indd 367 24/08/20 3:00 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,395,"368 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
on MRI does not confirm the diagnosis. Additional testing should be obtained to
confirm the source of Cushing syndrome prior to surgical resection.
Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS): The Endocrine Society recommends
IPSS for patients without an obvious causal tumor (ie, pituitary adenoma > 6 mm).
Blood from the pituitary drains into the inferior petrosal sinuses. During petro-
sal sinus sampling, blood is sampled from both petrosal sinuses and a peripheral
vein simultaneously. The central-to-peripheral ratio of ACTH is greater than 2:1
in patients with Cushing disease. Because ACTH secretion can be intermittent, it
is helpful to sample blood at regular intervals (2, 5, and 15 minutes) after CRH is
administered. A ratio greater than 3:1 after CRH administration has a sensitivity
and specificity of 94% for the diagnosis of Cushing disease.
The high-dose (8-mg) DST: Noninvasive testing may be sufficient to confirm a
diagnosis of Cushing disease if a pituitary adenoma greater than 6 mm is identified.
In patients with Cushing disease, ACTH secretion is partially resistant to feedback
inhibition from glucocorticoids. ACTH and cortisol secretion do not respond to
1 mg of dexamethasone (low-dose DST), whereas secretion is partially suppressed
following the administration of 8 mg of dexamethasone (high-dose DST). For the
high-dose DST, the patient takes 8 mg of dexamethasone between 11 pm and mid-
night. Cortisol is measured the following morning at 8 am. A 50% reduction in the
cortisol level from baseline indicates a positive result. The high-dose DST yields
high sensitivity but low specificity for identifying patients with Cushing disease.
CRH stimulation test: For the CRH stimulation test, ACTH and cortisol are
measured at baseline and then every 15 minutes for 1 to 2 hours after CRH is
administered. In healthy individuals, CRH produces a 15% to 20% increase in
ACTH and cortisol levels. This response is exaggerated in patients with Cush-
ing disease. ACTH typically increases by greater than 50%, and cortisol typically
increases by greater than 20%. No response is seen in patients with ectopic ACTH
syndrome. The sensitivity and specificity are approximately 90% for the diagnosis
of Cushing disease.
Treatment
The first-line approach to treatment is typically surgical resection of the causal
tumor. For example, if an adrenal adenoma is found, surgery is usually the best
option. Medical management may be considered in the following situations:
(1) persistent hypercortisolism following surgery, (2) a tumor that cannot be
resected (eg, ACTH-producing small-cell lung carcinoma with metastases), and
(3) situations in which cortisol levels need to be rapidly decreased in severely ill
patients. The medications listed in Table 35–1 are used to treat patients with
ACTH-independent or ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome.
Medications used to treat patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome
include somatostatin receptor agonists and dopamine agonists. Pasireotide is a soma-
tostatin receptor agonist that has a higher affinity for somatostatin receptor subtypes
1 and 5 than octreotide or lanreotide. ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas have high
expression of somatostatin receptor subtype 5. Pasireotide decreases ACTH secre-
tion and may decrease tumor size. Octreotide has been used to treat ectopic ACTH
syndrome. Some ACTH-secreting tumors express somatostatin receptor subtype 2.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO OSTEOPOROSIS
Epidemiology
Osteoporosis is an important health issue because the resultant bone fractures cause
a great deal of morbidity in chronic pain, loss of independence, and loss of func-
tion, as well as mortality. Risk factors for the development of osteoporotic fracture
include advanced age, previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, rheumatoid arthri-
tis, low body weight, loss of steroid hormone production (menopause or hypogo-
nadism), current smoking, excessive alcohol, and parental history of hip fracture.
The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) risk calculator is available online to
assess the 10-year probability of fracture. Approximately 14% of white women and
3% to 5% of white men will develop osteoporosis in their lifetime. The prevalence
is lower in African Americans and higher in Asians.

Case Files Internal Medicine,397,"370 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Pathophysiology
Osteoporosis can be either idiopathic or a manifestation of another underlying dis-
ease process. Probably the most common form of secondary osteoporosis is caused by
glucocorticoid excess, usually iatrogenic steroid use for an inflammatory disease such
as rheumatoid arthritis. Patients, both men and women, with rheumatoid arthri-
tis are susceptible to accelerated bone loss with even low doses of glucocorticoids.
Gonadal deficiency is another common cause, which is seen physiologically in meno-
pausal women but is seen pathologically in women who are amenorrheic (eg, female
athletes such as gymnasts or marathon runners) or as a result of hyperprolactinemia.
Men with gonadal failure for any reason also are prone to develop osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis is a common feature of several endocrinopathies. Patients with
hyperparathyroidism will develop osteoporosis because of increased calcium mobili-
zation from bone. Long-standing hyperthyroidism, either naturally occurring, as in
Graves disease, or as a result of excessive replacement of levothyroxine in patients
with hypothyroidism, will also lead to accelerated bone loss. Malnutrition and nutri-
tional deficiencies are causative and are often seen in patients with malabsorption;
for example, most patients, both men and women, with celiac sprue have osteoporo-
sis. Certain medications, such as cyclosporine, antiepileptics, heparin, and gonado-
tropin-releasing hormone inhibitors, among others, may accelerate bone loss.
Peak bone density occurs in young adulthood under the influence of sex steroid
hormone production. Other influential factors include genetics, which may account
for 80% of total bone density, adequate calcium intake, and level of physical activity,
especially weight-bearing activity. After age 35, bone breakdown begins to exceed
bone replacement, and this increases markedly after menopause as a consequence of
increased osteoclast activity.
Treatment
Treatment of osteoporosis takes a multifaceted approach. The first is avoidance of
medications or conditions that predispose to bone loss (smoking cessation, reduc-
tion of systemic steroid use, and attention to nutrition). Adequate calcium intake,
1000 mg/d for premenopausal women and adult men and 1200 mg with 400 to
800 IU of vitamin D per day for postmenopausal women, leads to decreased frac-
tures. Steroid estrogen receptor modulators such as raloxifene can increase bone
density and reduce fracture risk, as can the use of bisphosphonates, in combination
with both calcium and vitamin D. Bisphosphonates can lead to severe esophagi-
tis and must be used with caution in individuals with gastric reflux disease. Oral
bisphosphonates should be taken on an empty stomach, with a large quantity of
water, and the patient should remain in the upright position for at least 30 minutes.
Intravenous bisphosphonates are now available that can be infused quarterly or
annually. There is some concern about long-term effects of bisphosphonates,
including risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and paradoxical bone fragility causing
atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures. Many experts recommend a drug holiday
after 5 years of treatment for patients with stable BMD.
Weight-bearing physical activity decreases bone loss and improves coordination
and muscle strength, which may prevent falls. Ensuring that patients can see ade-
quately, that they use a cane or walker if needed, that throw rugs are removed, that
36_Toy-IM_Case35_p363-376.indd 370 24/08/20 3:00 PM"

patients have railings to hold onto in the shower or bath, or that they wear hip
protectors can further decrease the risk of life-altering bone fractures.

ANSWERS
35.1 B. This patient exhibits several signs and symptoms concerning for Cushing
syndrome, including weight gain, hypertension, irregular menses, facial full-
ness, hirsutism, and supraclavicular fat pads. The low-dose DST is one of
three tests performed to confirm the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Plasma
ACTH (answer C) is obtained to determine the etiology after a diagnosis of
Cushing syndrome is established. The high-dose DST (answer A) is one of
three diagnostic tests performed to confirm the source of ACTH-dependent
Cushing syndrome (ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma vs ectopic source).
A pituitary-protocol MRI (answer D) would not be performed until after the
diagnosis of Cushing is established. If Cushing syndrome is ruled out, other
36_Toy-IM_Case35_p363-376.indd 372 24/08/20 3:00 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,400,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 373
potential causes of the patient’s symptoms may include polycystic ovarian
syndrome, and pelvic ultrasound may be useful to evaluate for this condition.
35.2 C. A diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is confirmed by the positive low-dose
DST and two elevated 24-hour UFC values. Plasma ACTH should be mea-
sured to determine the etiology (ACTH-independent vs ACTH-dependent
Cushing syndrome). A pituitary-protocol MRI (answer D), high-dose DST
(answer A), or IPSS (answer B) may be obtained after a diagnosis of ACTH-
dependent Cushing syndrome is established.
35.3 A. A diagnosis of ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome is established by
the suppressed ACTH level. A CT of the adrenal glands should be obtained
to determine the type of adrenal lesion. A pituitary-protocol MRI (answer C),
chest CT (answer B), or neck CT (answer D) may be obtained to identify the
source of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome.
35.4 C. This young man has clinical findings of corticosteroid excess based on
decreased libido, weight gain, bruising, and supraclavicular fullness (fat pad).
The elevated serum cortisol not suppressed with dexamethasone and two
salivary cortisol levels confirms hypercortisolism. A 24 hour UFC is not nec-
essary since Cushing syndrome has already been established using two tests.
The next step is to determine whether this is an ACTH-dependent or inde-
pendent process. Because of the normal serum ACTH levels, this patient
has ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome; ACTH-independent Cushing
syndrome is associated with low levels of serum ACTH. The third step is to
determine the source of the ACTH. Most of the time, it will arise from the
pituitary gland, but can also result from an ectopic ACTH producing loca-
tion. This patient has a normal MRI of the pituitary gland; however, this
finding does not exclude a diagnosis of Cushing disease (pituitary adenoma)
since MRI is only 60% sensitive in these patients; nevertheless, because the
MRI is non-invasive, it is the initial test used. If the MRI is negative as in this
patient’s situation, the more invasive IPSS (answer C) is recommended to
distinguish between an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma versus a periph-
eral source of ACTH. IPSS assesses the ACTH levels of the veins draining
the pituitary gland. If the IPSS shows low levels of venous ACTH, then
an ectopic source of ACTH is responsible, and a CT of the neck, chest, or
abdomen/pelvis (answers A and B) may be obtained. If the IPSS is positive
for elevated ACTH, then affected patients usually undergo transsphenoidal
surgery or medical management if surgery is not possible.
35.5 A. The T score is the number of SDs of a patient BMD from the mean of
young, adult, white women. It is the standard measurement of BMD used by
the World Health Organization. Osteopenia is defined as a T score of 1 to
−2.4. A score of –2.5 SD is the definition of osteoporosis. A Z score is the
number of standard deviations from the mean BMD of women in the same age
group as the patient. Based on this terminology, the patient has osteoporosis
of the spine (T score −2.5) and osteopenia of the hip (T score −1.5). The
other answer choices (B, C, and D) are inaccurate assessments of the T score.

Answer E (Z score) is age-matched evaluation and not used in the definition
of osteoporosis/osteopenia. This patient would benefit from review of her
diet, assessment of vitamin D intake and levels, cessation of anything that
would compromise bone health, and recommendation of starting pharmaco-
logical therapy such as a bisphosphonate.
35.6 D. This patient has osteoporosis based on the DEXA scan findings of −2.5
and −2.6. Bisphosphonates would decrease her risk of hip fractures by 30%
to 50%. Alendronate and risedronate have been associated with a lower all-
cause mortality. Answer A (osteopenia) is defined as a T score between −1
and −2.5. Answer B (estrogen) primarily inhibits loss of bone mass, although
not only can it help to build a modest amount of bone mass, but it may also
be associated with increased thrombotic and cardiovascular risk; for this rea-
son, osteoporosis is not an indication to start estrogen replacement therapy
in postmenopausal women. Answer C (swimming) is not helpful; weight-
bearing exercise, not swimming or bicycling, is important in preventing
osteoporosis.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Osteoporosis is a condition of decreased bone mass and microarchitec-

tural abnormalities that predisposes the patient to fragility fractures.
The T score is a common way of assessing clinical BMD. Osteoporosis is

defined as T score of −2.5 or less.
Osteopenia is defined as a T score of between −1 and −2.5.

Chronic exposure to excessive corticosteroids is the most common cause

of secondary osteoporosis.
Bisphosphonates are the most common first-line agent for osteoporosis,

but they do have some rare but significant side effects.
Cushing syndrome refers to the signs and symptoms that develop when

the body is exposed to excess glucocorticoids.
Signs of Cushing syndrome include facial fullness, plethora (ie, red face),

supraclavicular or dorsocervical fat pads, reddish-purple striae, proximal
muscle weakness, and unexplained bruising.
Once Cushing syndrome is suspected, one of three tests should be
»
obtained: 24-hour UFC, late-night salivary cortisol, or the low-dose
(1-mg) overnight DST. If the initial test is positive, one of the remaining
tests must be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.
After a diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is confirmed, plasma ACTH should
»
be measured to determine the etiology (ACTH-independent vs ACTH-
dependent Cushing syndrome).

For ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome, the source (pituitary vs ecto-

IPSS, the high-dose (8-mg) DST, and the CRH stimulation test.
The first-line treatment of Cushing syndrome is surgical resection of

the causal tumor. Medical management may be considered in certain
situations.
Medications include steroidogenesis inhibitors (ketoconazole, metyra-

A 72-year-old man is seen in the emergency department because of the acute onset
of a right facial droop, right arm weakness, and some difficulty speaking. These
symptoms started 6 hours ago while he was sitting at the breakfast table. He had
no headache, no loss of consciousness, and no abnormal involuntary movements.
Two weeks ago, he had a transient painless loss of vision in his left eye, which
resolved spontaneously within a few hours. His medical history is significant for
long-standing hypertension and a myocardial infarction 4 years previously, which
was treated with percutaneous angioplasty. His medications include a daily aspirin
(81 mg), metoprolol, and simvastatin. He does not smoke. When you see him in
the emergency department, his symptoms have nearly resolved. He is afebrile,
heart rate is 62 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure (BP) is 135/87 mm Hg.
The right corner of his mouth droops, with slight flattening of the right nasolabial
fold, but he is able to fully elevate his eyebrows. His strength is 4/5 in his right
arm and hand, and the rest of his neurologic examination, including cerebellar
testing and gait, are normal. He has no carotid bruits; his heart rhythm is regular
with no murmur but with an S gallop. The remainder of his physical examination

is normal. Laboratory studies, including renal function, liver function, lipid profile,
glucose, and complete blood count (CBC), are normal. Within a few hours, all of
the patient’s symptoms have resolved.

ANSWERS TO CASE 36:
Transient Ischemic Attack
Summary: A 72-year-old man presents with
Acute onset of right facial droop and right arm weakness and some difficulty speak-

ing, which resolves within hours
No headache, decreased consciousness, or abnormal involuntary movements

Previous transient painless loss of vision in his left eye that resolved spontaneously

within a few hours
Known atherosclerotic disease but no carotid bruits

Most likely diagnosis: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) most likely caused by ath-
eroembolism from the left internal carotid artery.
Next step: Perform urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the most common mechanisms for ischemic stroke: carotid stenosis,
cardioembolism, and small-vessel disease. (EPA 2, 10)
2. Understand the evaluation of a stroke patient with the goal of secondary pre-
vention. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Differentiate patients best managed with medical therapy from those who
benefit from carotid endarterectomy (CEA). (EPA 4)
Considerations
Patients who present with acute focal neurologic deficits require rapid evaluation
for suspected stroke. The saying is, “Time is brain tissue.” An efficient but thor-
ough neurologic examination should include cranial nerve testing, somatic motor
strength, somatic sensory testing, speech and language assessment, and cerebel-
lar testing, including gait. Neurologic scoring should be done on a standardized
manner such as the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale. Emergency labora-
tory work, such as glucose, CBC, electrolytes, and coagulation profile, and elec-
trocardiography (ECG) are important. Noncontrast CT of the brain is necessary
to differentiate between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, which cannot
be definitively distinguished clinically. If CT shows no hemorrhage and no large
multilobar infarction (> one-third of the cerebral hemisphere), patients with the
clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic attack may receive thrombolytics (intravenous
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]) as long as it can be delivered
within 3 hours (some patients may be treated with intravenous thrombolytics up
to 4.5 hours) of the onset of symptoms; this is associated with a reduction in
mortality and disability. Thus, rapid triaging of patients with possible TIA/stroke
is critical.

Case Files Internal Medicine,406,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 379
This 72-year-old man presented more than 6 hours after the onset of symptoms
and has had resolution of neurologic deficits, consistent with a suspected diagnosis
of TIA. He has established atherosclerotic coronary disease but no known carotid
artery disease. He denies headache, which is important because migraine headache
may be associated with neurologic deficits; it would be rare for an elderly man to
have the first presentation of migraine headache. Various neurologic diseases, such
as multiple sclerosis, may be characterized by complete resolution of neurologic
deficits, but the symptoms usually last longer than 24 hours. He does not have
abnormal motor activity, which might suggest seizure disorder.
If the noncontrast CT excludes acute intracranial pathology, the patient
should be counseled about secondary prevention of future ischemic events; this
includes risk factor reduction through antiplatelet and statin therapy, BP con-
trol, smoking cessation, and noninvasive imaging of the carotid arteries to deter-
mine the extent of stenosis. With the patient’s symptoms, if there is more than
70% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, the possibility of left CEA should
be discussed.
APPROACH TO:
Transient Ischemic Attack and Prevention of Stroke
DEFINITIONS
AMAUROSIS FUGAX: Transient monocular blindness that often is described as
a gray shade being pulled down over the eye caused by retinal ischemia, most often
due to emboli originating from the carotid artery.
CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (CVA): Also known as stroke. Acute onset
of a focal neurologic deficit due to a cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. CVAs are
widely subdivided into ischemic and hemorrhagic.
TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK: Transient neurologic deficit caused by focal
brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Transient ischemic attacks, often called “ministrokes,” typically refer to the
sudden onset of a focal neurologic deficit, with spontaneous resolution within
24 hours (usually within the first hour). However, current definition of TIA
focuses on a biological end point (tissue injury) rather than an arbitrary time
cutoff. Recent understanding is that there is risk of tissue infarction, even when
focal symptoms resolve within less than 24 hours, which may be visualized on
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted or perfusion-
weighted imaging.
Not all transient focal neurologic events actually represent ischemia, however.
The differential diagnosis includes classic migraine, postictal paralysis, seizures,
37_Toy-IM_Case36_p377-386.indd 379 24/08/20 3:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,407,"380 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
certain infections, prolonged hypoglycemia, cerebral hemorrhage, or even slow-
evolving intracranial processes such as subdural hematoma, abscess, or tumors,
which can suddenly produce symptoms because of edema or hemorrhage or can
result in seizure activity. However, clinical evaluation and imaging studies of the
brain should be sufficient to exclude most or all of these diagnoses.
TIAs are produced by temporary ischemia to a vascular territory, usually caused
by thrombosis or embolism and less commonly by vasculitis, hematologic disorders
such as sickle cell disease, or vasospasm. By far, the most common causes of stroke
or TIA are carotid atherosclerosis (large-vessel disease); cardioembolism, usually to
branches of the middle cerebral artery (medium-size vessel disease); or lipohyali-
nosis affecting the small lenticulostriate arteries (small-vessel disease).
Clinical Presentation
The focal neurologic symptoms produced by ischemia depend on the area of the
cerebral circulation involved and may include (1) amaurosis fugax, (2) hemiparesis,
(3) hemianesthesia, (4) aphasia, or (5) dizziness/vertigo as a result of vertebro-
basilar insufficiency. The significance of a TIA is not the symptoms it produces
because by definition it is self-resolved, but the risk for future events it portends.
The highest-risk patients for stroke are those with previous ischemic events such as
TIA; that is, it can be looked on as a warning sign of recurrent stroke, which may
be disabling. Table 36–1 shows the ABCD2 scoring system, which can be used to
triage patients with TIA to assess their risk for recurrent events within the first
3 months (most of them occur within the first 2 days).
The workup for a TIA begins with a history and physical examination (see
Table 36–2). Pertinent historical factors include time of onset, course, duration

of symptoms, atherosclerotic risk factors, and relevant medical history (ie, atrial
fibrillation). Physical examination should begin with BPs in all four extremities and
should include a fundoscopic examination. In this patient, the first symptom was
amaurosis fugax due to cholesterol emboli, called Hollenhorst plaques, which often
can be seen lodged in the retinal artery. Auscultation for carotid bruits, cardiac
murmurs, assessment of cardiac rhythm, evidence of embolic events to other parts
of the body, and a complete neurologic examination should also be performed.
A noncontrast CT scan (or some institutions prefer MRI) of the brain also must
be performed initially. Noncontrast CT scans of the brain are very sensitive in
detecting acute cerebral hemorrhage but are relatively insensitive to acute ischemic
strokes, particularly when the area of the stroke is less than 5 mm in diameter or
is located in the region of the brainstem or if the stroke is less than 12 hours old.
Further imaging with magnetic resonance may be considered. Laboratory data that
should always be obtained include CBC, fasting lipid profile, and serum glucose
level. Other laboratory data, such as an erythrocyte sedimentation rate in elderly
populations to evaluate for temporal arteritis, should be tailored to the patient. Gen-
erally, a 12-lead ECG must be obtained to evaluate for atrial fibrillation. An echo-
cardiogram can be useful to evaluate for valvular or mural thrombi, along with a
bubble study to assess for a connection between the atria. Finally, imaging of the
extracranial vasculature to detect severe carotid artery stenosis is essential to guide
further stroke prevention therapy. Carotid Doppler ultrasound and magnetic reso-
nance angiography are effective noninvasive imaging studies and are often used as
first-line diagnostic tools.

Case Files Internal Medicine,409,"382 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Treatment
Stroke prevention begins with antiplatelet therapy, and aspirin should be used in all
cases unless there is a contraindication to its use. Aspirin should be started within
48 hours of a TIA or stroke. However, if tPA is used, it is best to wait 24 hours
after administration of the tPA to start aspirin therapy. Use of clopidogrel or com-
bination aspirin and dipyridamole may be slightly superior to aspirin for stroke pre-
vention but at a substantially higher cost. Combination therapy with aspirin and
clopidogrel has not been shown to provide greater benefit in stroke prevention but
does produce a higher rate of bleeding complications.
For patients with TIA/stroke as a consequence of carotid atherosclerosis, medical
management includes antiplatelet agents and aggressive risk reduction via BP con-
trol, treatment of hyperlipidemia and diabetes, and smoking cessation. In the acute
phase of an ischemic event, when a patient has neurologic symptoms, hypertension
is not to be dropped significantly since arterial BP that is too low may underper-
fuse the brain tissue beyond a blockage (this concept is recognized as permissive
hypertension). Acute BP management is recommended only when systolic BP > 220
mm Hg, diastolic BP > 120 mm Hg, or tPA will be administered (goal of systolic
BP < 185 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 110 mm Hg). Blood glucose should be main-
tained between 140 and 180 mg/dL during a stroke, as tight glucose control shows
a mortality benefit poststroke.
As a part of future stroke risk reduction, after 24 hours, if the patient is stable
neurologically, antihypertensive therapy can be restarted in patients with known
hypertension. Patients with a TIA who are stable several days after the event and
are found to have elevated BP pressure (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) should be treated to a
goal BP of < 140 mm Hg systolic and < 90 mm Hg diastolic. High-intensity statin
therapy should be initiated for all TIA patients to reduce the risk of stroke and other
cardiovascular events. These patients should also undergo screening for diabetes
with hemoglobin A , fasting glucose measurement, or glucose tolerance test, and
1C
they should be treated based on the American Diabetic Association guidelines.
Patients who are obese (body mass index > 30 kg/m2) should be encouraged to
implement lifestyle modifications to lose weight. While the effect of weight loss on
stroke prevention is unclear, weight loss can help control other risk factors. Last,
smoking cessation is an extremely important step to take in reducing the risk of a
stroke, as primary prevention, as well as after a TIA.
For patients with cardioembolic stroke as a result of atrial fibrillation, long-term
anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin) reduces the risk of systemic emboliza-
tion by approximately 70%. Newer oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, apixaban,
rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) have recently been approved for patients with atrial
fibrillation and are comparable in efficacy to warfarin with lower risk of cerebral
bleeding. The risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation can be predicted
using the CHADS2-Vasc score. For patients with small-vessel disease-producing
lacunar infarctions, BP control and antiplatelet agents are the mainstays of therapy.
For TIA patients found to have carotid artery stenosis, in addition to medical
therapy as described previously, patients should be evaluated for carotid artery end-
arterectomy (open surgery to remove plaques), carotid artery angioplasty (percutane-
ous intervention where inflation of a balloon is used to open the artery), or stenting.
37_Toy-IM_Case36_p377-386.indd 382 24/08/20 3:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,410,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 383
Surgical endarterectomy for severe carotid artery stenosis has successfully reduced
the long-term risk of stroke in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. For
patients who suffer a TIA or stroke and have an ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis
greater than 70%, CEA reduces the rate of stroke and is highly recommended. For
symptomatic patients with stenosis of 50% to 69%, CEA can reduce the future
stroke risk, but it is recommended on a case-by-case basis, taking the patient’s char-
acteristics into account. For asymptomatic patients with greater than 60% stenoses,
endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke as well, but to a much lesser degree than
symptomatic patients. It should be noted that the surgery is not without risk and
can actually cause significant morbidity and mortality from a postsurgical stroke;
therefore, the surgery should be performed in a center with very low surgical mor-
bidity and mortality.
In asymptomatic patients, carotid surgery should only be performed when there
is relatively low comorbidity and a long life expectancy in order to gain the most
benefit. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is available for patients with carotid stenosis,
but like endarterectomy, it also carries a risk of embolization and stroke. Stenting
may be considered as an alternative to surgery for symptomatic patients who are
high-risk surgical candidates or for patients with anatomy that would prevent open
surgery. In patients over the age of 70 years, endarterectomy is associated with bet-
ter outcomes. In younger patients, endarterectomy and stenting are considered
equal in terms of periprocedural complications. For carotid stenosis of less than
50%, neither CAS nor CEA is recommended.

B. Lacunar infarction involving right internal capsule
C. Stenosis of right subclavian artery due to atherosclerosis
D. Multiple sclerosis
ANSWERS
36.1 C. This patient has symptomatic carotid disease, which includes symptoms
such as TIAs and small, nondisabling ischemic strokes. A patient who pres-
ents with symptomatic carotid disease and stenosis between 70% and 99%
should receive a CEA. It has been found that patients over the age of 70
fare better with a CEA than stenting alone (answer D). When symptomatic
patients present with stenosis between 50% and 69%, management depends
on gender. Women tend to have better outcomes with optimal medical man-
agement, whereas men have improved outcomes with CEA. Medical therapy
such as antiplatelet medication (answer A) or anticoagulation (answer B) is
not as effective as CEA in this circumstance. Tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA) (answer E) is indicated for thromobotic strokes within 4.5 hours of
onset of symptoms and not appropriate in this patient’s setting.
37_Toy-IM_Case36_p377-386.indd 384 24/08/20 3:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,412,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 385
36.2 D. Multiple neurologic deficits separated in space and time in a young patient
are suggestive of multiple sclerosis. The symptoms lasting longer than
24 hours as well as the patient’s age make TIAs (answer A), even if recurrent,
less likely to be the cause of her symptoms. A subarachnoid hemorrhage
(answer B) will often present with a “thunder clap headache” or “the worst
headache” of the patient’s life and is usually an isolated event. A complicated
migraine (answer C) can include symptoms such as changes in vision and arm
weakness but with or before the onset of the headache.
36.3 A. Vertigo and dizziness can be seen in vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Tran-
sient monocular blindness or amaurosis fugax is associated with internal
carotid (answer B) pathology. Face weakness, dysarthria, and hemiplegia
greater in the upper extremity are associated with pathology in the middle
cerebral artery (answer D). A problem of the aorta (answer C) would lead to
global brain ischemia as well as multiorgan insufficiency.
36.4 C. The patient likely has subclavian steal: the phenomenon of flow reversal
in the vertebral artery ipsilateral to a hemodynamically significant stenosis
of the subclavian artery. The neurologic symptoms can be caused by verte-
brobasilar ischemia, hence the problems with vertigo. The difference in BP
in both arms strongly suggests this diagnosis. Left middle cerebral artery
stroke (answer A) would lead to speech difficulties and right hemiplegia.
Lacunar infarcts involving the right internal capsule (answer B) would lead
to transient left-sided arm/leg weakness or sensory deficits and not vertigo.
Multiple sclerosis (answer D), which is a demyelinating disease affecting
the white matter of the brain, can lead to a variety of deficits, including
vertigo, weakness, and diplopia; however, there is no difference in BP in the
arms with MS.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The most common causes of cerebral infarction are carotid athero-
»
sclerotic stenosis, cardioembolism, and small-vessel disease such as
lipohyalinosis.
Cerebral infarction, TIA, and amaurosis fugax all may be symptoms of
»
carotid stenosis.
In symptomatic patients with severe stenosis > 70%, CEA is superior to
»
medical therapy in stroke prevention, provided the surgical risk is low
(< 6%).
For other patients, stroke prevention consists mainly of antiplatelet
»
agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) and risk factor modification, for example,
lowering BP, controlling hypercholesterolemia, and smoking cessation.

Seeming more withdrawn with a flat affect

Orientation to person and place, but not to time

Low MMSE score

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. List some of the common causes and evaluation of dementia. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Understand the presentation and diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Recognize that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may slow the progression of
dementia. (EPA 4)
Considerations
In this elderly patient with slowly progressive decline in memory and cognitive
functioning, dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most likely diagnosis.
As in other cases of major organ system failure (heart and kidney failures), demen-
tia (“brain failure”) necessitates investigation into treatable or reversible causes
before assigning a diagnosis such as AD, which is progressive and incurable and has
no effective treatment. In most studies, AD accounts for about 70% of dementia,
and about 10% to 20% is due to vascular disorders such as stroke. However, alcohol
use disorder, Parkinson, hypothyroidism, and less common disorders should still
be explored. Also, depressive disorder needs to be further evaluated. Depression is
more common in older patients and can mimic cognitive decline.

APPROACH TO:
Dementia
DEFINITIONS
ALZHEIMER DISEASE: Leading cause of dementia, accounting for half of the
cases involving elderly individuals, associated with diffuse cortical and hippocam-
pal atrophy with ventricular enlargement. The pathologic changes in the brains
of patients with AD include neurofibrillary tangles and deposition of abnormal
amyloid in the brain. Risk factors include advanced age, positive family history, and
presence of apolipoprotein E4 allele.
DEMENTIA (also called major neurocognitive disorder): Significant cognitive
impairment in more than one of the following cognitive domains: learning and
memory, language, executive function, complex attention, perceptual-motor func-
tion, or social cognition. The impairment represents a decline from previous level
of ability, interferes with daily functioning and independent living, and is not occur-
ring exclusively during an episode of delirium.
VASCULAR (MULTI-INFARCT) DEMENTIA: Dementia in the setting of cere-
brovascular disease, occurring after multiple cerebral infarctions, whether large or
small (lacunar).
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
In assessing the patient with dementia, the clinician should strive to answer three
questions: (1) What is the most likely diagnosis? (2) Is there any treatable or revers-
ible condition contributing to the patient’s cognitive decline? (3) What interven-
tions are available to preserve the patient’s level of function and relieve the burden
to caregivers?
To answer the first question, the most important investigation is the history of
symptoms. If the patient has an acute or subacute onset of confusion or has a fluc-
tuating level of consciousness, the most likely diagnosis is delirium, which can be
due to infection, intoxication, adverse medication effects, medication withdrawal,
or metabolic derangements such as hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, or hypoglycemia.
Depression and Pseudodementia. If cognitive decline occurs with prominent
mood disturbance, then depression or pseudodementia must be considered. Dis-
tinguishing which occurred first is often difficult because many elderly patients
with cognitive decline and a declining level of independent functioning suffer from
a reactive depression. History provided by involved family members regarding
the onset of symptoms or history of prior depression or other psychiatric illness
may help establish the diagnosis, and an empiric trial of antidepressants may be
considered. An MMSE score of 26 or less suggests mild dementia, with declin-
ing scores suggesting more severe dementia. However, a patient should also be
screened for depression (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) to rule it
out before a diagnosis of dementia is established. Cognitive screenings such as the
38_Toy-IM_Case37_p387-396.indd 389 24/08/20 3:09 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,417,"390 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) have relatively high sensi-
tivity (75%-92%) and specificity (81%-91%) for dementia and should be used in
screening.
Vascular Dementia. If the patient has a history of irregular stepwise decline
in functioning—especially if the patient has had apparent stroke symptoms
or transient ischemic events or has a known cardiovascular disease or atrial
fibrillation—then vascular, or multi-infarct, dementia is the most likely diagnosis.
Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in the United States,
comprising 10% to 20% of dementias. Other patients with cerebrovascular disease,
especially as a result of long-standing hypertension, may develop diffuse subcorti-
cal white matter changes seen on imaging, presenting with an insidious rather than
sudden stepwise decline in cognitive function. This condition is often referred to as
Binswanger disease or subcortical arteriosclerotic leukoencephalopathy.
Other Causes. Other common causes of dementia include long-standing alco-
holism and parkinsonism. Both these conditions may be discovered by the appropri-
ate history or physical findings (eg, resting tremor with bradykinesia and masked
faces of parkinsonism). Other dementia syndromes include behavioral changes
with intact navigation in frontotemporal dementia or rapid progression of dementia
with muscular rigidity and myoclonus in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Less common causes of dementia include Wernicke encephalopathy caused
from thiamine (vitamin B ) deficiency, vitamin B deficiency resulting from per-
1 12
nicious anemia, untreated hypothyroidism, or chronic infections such as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or neurosyphilis.
Many primary central nervous system (CNS) diseases can lead to dementia or
other cognitive dysfunction, including Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, neo-
plastic diseases such as primary or metastatic brain tumors (more likely to pro-
duce seizures or focal deficits rather than dementia), or leptomeningeal spread of
malignancies. Short-term memory loss, as seen in other dementias, seizures, and
psychiatric symptoms, can result from paraneoplastic encephalitis mediated by
autoantibodies found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (eg, limbic encephalitis).
Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a potentially reversible form of dementia in
which the cerebral ventricles slowly enlarge as a result of disturbances to cerebral
spinal fluid resorption. The classic triad is dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary or
bowel incontinence (wacky, wobbly, and wet). Relief of hydrocephalus through place-
ment of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may reverse the cognitive decline. Descrip-
tions of the primary neurologic diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction are
listed in Table 37–1.
Once likely diagnoses have been established by history and physical examina-
tion, investigation should be undertaken to look for treatable or reversible causes.
The choice of laboratory or imaging tests is not straightforward because of the
numerous, yet uncommon, causes of reversible dementia. Tests that may be con-
sidered for the evaluation of dementia are listed in Table 37–2. The American
Academy of Neurology recommends routine assessment of thyroid function tests, a
vitamin B level, and a neuroimaging study, either with computed tomography (CT)
12
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.

Clinical Presentation
For patients with AD, the average life expectancy after diagnosis is 7 to 10 years.
The clinical course is characterized by progressive decline of cognitive functions
(memory, orientation, attention, and concentration) and the development of psy-
chological and behavioral symptoms (wandering, aggression, anxiety, depression,
and psychosis). Table 37–3 outlines the clinical stages of AD.
Treatment
The goals of treatment in AD are to (1) improve cognitive function, (2) reduce
behavioral and psychological symptoms, and (3) improve the quality of life. Done-
pezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are cholinesterase inhibitors that are effective in
improving cognitive function and global clinical state.

Antagonists to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, such as memantine, are
effective in moderate-to-severe dementia. Antipsychotics such as risperidone can
reduce psychotic symptoms and aggression in patients with dementia but must be
used with caution. The Beers Criteria list potentially inappropriate medications for
older adults that are associated with negative outcomes; this includes medications
that could contribute to altered mental status, which could then be confused for
or worsen underlying dementia. For this reason, as well as to avoid polypharmacy,
routine medication reconciliation should be done by a primary care provider or
whenever a patient is admitted to a hospital.
Other issues include wakefulness, night walking and wandering, aggression,
incontinence, and depression. A structured environment, with predictability and
judicious use of pharmacotherapy, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
37.1 A 78-year-old woman is being followed in the office for cognitive decline over
the past year. The patient’s daughter states that the patient has been forgetting
where she is going and has left the stove on for hours. She is otherwise healthy
and denies neurologic symptoms. A workup including laboratory work and
head imaging has been negative. The patient is diagnosed with early AD. Which
of the following agents is most likely to help with the cognitive function?
A. Haloperidol
B. Estrogen replacement therapy
C. Donepezil
D. High-dose vitamin B injections
12
37.2 A 74-year-old man was noted to have excellent cognitive and motor skills
12 months ago. His wife noted that 6 months ago his function deteriorated
noticeably of somewhat sudden onset, and he seemed to be at this new base-
line until he became worse 2 months ago. Which of the following is most
likely to reveal the etiology of his functional decline?
A. HIV antibody test
B. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
C. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Venereal Disease Research Laboratory
(VDRL) test
D. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone
37.3 A 55-year-old man is noted by his family members to be forgetful and become
disoriented. He has difficulty making it to the bathroom in time and com-
plains of feeling as though “he is walking like he was drunk.” Which of the
following therapies is most likely to improve his condition?
A. Intravenous penicillin for 21 days
B. Rivastigmine
C. Treatment with fluoxetine for 9 to 12 months
D. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
E. Enrollment into Alcoholics Anonymous

Case Files Internal Medicine,421,"394 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
37.4 A 68-year-old man is brought into the clinic due to the patient having dif-
ficulty with his memory and with cooking for and shopping for himself. His
wife passed away 2 years previously. He often becomes confused about where
he is and gets lost when he takes a walk in the neighborhood. He is diagnosed
with AD. A CT scan of the brain is performed. Which of the following is
most likely to be seen on imaging?
A. Chronic subdural hematoma
B. Cortical atrophy with atrophy of medial temporal structures
C. Ventriculomegaly without cortical atrophy
D. Normal cerebral ventricles and normal brain tissue, acetylcholine
deficiency
ANSWERS
37.1 C. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donezepil help with the cognitive func-
tion in AD and may slow the progression. Cholinesterase inhibitors are con-
sidered first-line therapy. Haloperidol (answer A) is an antipsychotic agent
and is used for patients who display psychosis. It is not useful for early AD.
Answer B (estrogen replacement therapy) and answer D (vitamin B injec-
12
tions) are not effective treatments for AD.
37.2 B. This is a patient who seems to have a more abrupt staggering or stepwise
decline in cognitive function rather than the more gradual decline seen in AD.
The stepwise decline in function is typical for multi-infarct dementia, diag-
nosed by viewing multiple areas of the brain infarct. HIV antibody testing
(answer A) can suggest HIV dementia or CNS lymphoma, but this patient
does not seem to have risk factors for this infection. CSF for syphilis (answer C)
and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone for hypothyroidism (answer D) test
for conditions that are usually associated with a gradual decline in cognitive
function, versus the stepwise and staggering cognitive decline.
37.3 D. The classic triad for normal-pressure hydrocephalus is dementia, inconti-
nence, and gait disturbance; one treatment is shunting the CSF. A favorable
response to large volume (30-50 mL) extraction of CSF can predict the use-
fulness of the shunt. Intravenous penicillin (answer A) is the treatment for
neurosyphilis. Rivastigmine (answer B) is a cholinesterase inhibitor and is
used for moderate-to-severe AD. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor used for depressive disorders. Referral to AA (answer E) is not indi-
cated unless medical causes for his condition are ruled out and alcohol abuse
disorder is diagnosed.
37.4 B. Alzheimer disease has no pathognomonic structural imaging criteria but
may include cortical and mesial temporal atrophy. This is in contrast to nor-
mal-pressure hydrocephalus, which shows enlarged brain ventricles without
significant brain atrophy (answer C). Functional imaging can detect decreased
perfusion and decreased metabolism in the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal
cortex in patients with AD. Chronic subdural hematomas (answer A) may be
38_Toy-IM_Case37_p387-396.indd 394 24/08/20 3:09 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,422,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 395
seen in patients who have repeated falls or trauma; this can be due to elder
abuse or alcohol abuse. Acetylcholine deficiency without structural problems
(answer D) cannot be evaluated on CT imaging since neurotransmitters are
not evaluated on this imaging; however, normal neuroimaging may be present
with early AD. This patient has moderate-to-severe AD, and there are very
likely to be abnormal findings on CT imaging of the head.

A 59-year-old woman comes to your clinic because she is concerned that she
might have a brain tumor. She reports a severe headache for the last 3 weeks
that she rates as an 8 on a scale of 0-10. She localizes the pain to the right side
of her head and reports that it is constant, occasionally throbbing, but mostly a
dull ache. She thinks the pain is worse at night, especially when she lies with that
side of her head on the pillow. She also has some pain with chewing her food.
She denies any nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or other visual disturbances. She
has had headaches before, but they were mostly occipital and frontal, relieved
by acetaminophen, and she attributed them to “stress.” Her medical history is
significant for hypertension, which is controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, and
“arthritis” of her neck, shoulders, and hips, for which she takes ibuprofen for when
she feels stiff and achy. On physical examination, her temperature is 100.4 °F, heart
rate is 88 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 126/75 mm Hg, and respiratory
rate is 12 breaths per minute. Her visual acuity is normal, visual fields are intact,
and her fundoscopic examination is significant for arteriolar narrowing but no
papilledema or hemorrhage. She has moderate tenderness over the right side of
her head but no obvious scalp lesions. Her chest is clear, and her heart rhythm is
regular, with normal S and S but an S gallop. Abdominal examination is benign.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the clinical features that help to distinguish a benign headache from
one representing a serious underlying illness. (EPA 2, 10)
2. Describe the clinical features and diagnostic tests for GCA. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Describe the clinical features of subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraine headache,
cluster headache, and tension headache. (EPA 1, 10)
Considerations
Although headaches are a very common complaint, this patient has features that
are of greater concern: older age of onset, abrupt onset, severe intensity, and dis-
similarity to previous milder headaches. The mnemonic SNOOP can be used
as a reminder of red flags of significant underlying pathology and is outlined
in Table 38–1. This patient is very concerned that the headaches may indicate a
brain tumor. She has no meningeal signs, and her neurologic examination is nonfo-
cal. She has stiffness and achiness of the shoulder and hip girdles. Together, these
Table 38–1 • RED FLAGS FOR SERIOUS HEADACHE DISORDERS
Any of these findings should prompt further investigation, including brain imaging (CT or MRI):
• Systemic symptoms, illness, or condition (fever, cancer, HIV or other immunocompromised state)
• Neurologic signs or symptoms (altered mental status, loss of consciousness, focal neurologic
signs, seizures, meningismus)
• Onset is new (especially age > 40) or sudden (thunderclap headache)
• Other associated conditions or features (head trauma, headache awakens from sleep, worse with
Valsalva, exertion, or sexual activity)
• Previous headache history with progressive symptoms or change in frequency or severity

Case Files Internal Medicine,426,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 399
factors make the diagnosis of GCA a strong possibility. GCA usually has its onset in
patients age 50 or older and occurs in females more often than males. GCA involves
inflammation of the medium- or large-size vessels. Her low-grade fever and gen-
eralized body aches may represent polymyalgia rheumatica, which is often associ-
ated with GCA. Other associated symptoms include jaw claudication and transient
vision loss. Although GCA is not a common cause of headache, untreated patients
can develop permanent vision loss resulting from ophthalmic artery involvement.
Thus, a low index of suspicion is sufficient to begin investigation. The diagnosis
could be suggested by an elevated ESR but can only be confirmed by temporal
artery biopsy (ESR is a nonspecific marker of inflammation). However, a negative
biopsy does not entirely rule out the diagnosis of GCA. Based on the sampled area
of the biopsy and due to the discontinuous involvement of arterial pathology, mul-
tiple biopsies may be necessary to adequately assess the artery for disease. Indeed, if
clinical suspicion is high, high-dose corticosteroids should be administered before
the diagnosis is established to prevent irreversible complications.
APPROACH TO:
Headache
DEFINITIONS
BERRY ANEURYSM: A small, thin-walled protrusion from the intracranial arter-
ies that has a “berry” appearance on angiographic imaging. They classically occur
at the junction where a cerebral artery departs from the circle of Willis. Over time,
increased pressure at the aneurysm can compromise the endothelial lining and pre-
dispose a rupture to occur, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP): An acute-phase protein of hepatic origin whose
concentrations in blood plasma increase in response to inflammation.
ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR): The rate at which erythro-
cytes suspended in plasma fall when placed in a vertical tube. It is an indirect mea-
sure of acute-phase response (ie, inflammation).
GIANT CELL ARTERITIS (GCA): Also known as temporal arteritis; a form
of systemic vascular inflammation most commonly affecting patients older than
50 years. Medium- and large-size vessels, especially the superficial temporal artery,
are affected.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Headache is one of the most common complaints of patients in medical practice.
As with many common symptoms, a broad range of conditions, from trivial to
life threatening, might be responsible. About 90% of all headaches fall under a
few main categories of what are called “primary headaches”: tension, migraine, and

cluster headaches. Headache symptoms usually are accompanied by a shortage of
associated laboratory findings, leaving the clinician to depend largely on a thor-
ough history with focused neurologic examination as the initial workup. Careful
history and physical examination, keeping in mind the red flags of headaches (see
Table 38–1), will serve the clinician well. Differentiating serious underlying causes
of headache from benign causes may be difficult. Table 38–2 lists some typical
features of different causes of headache.
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
One of the most catastrophic causes of headache is subarachnoid hemorrhage, usu-
ally secondary to a ruptured intracerebral (berry) aneurysm. A study of alert and
oriented patients presenting to the emergency center with a sudden-onset head-
ache peaking in severity within 1 hour revealed 6% of patients had a subarachnoid
39_Toy-IM_Case38_p397-404.indd 400 24/08/20 3:10 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,428,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 401
hemorrhage. The initial hemorrhage may be fatal, result in severe neurologic
impairment, or produce only minor symptoms such as headache. Neurologic find-
ings may not be present initially, and the patient who will benefit the most from
intervention will often have mild symptoms; thus, it is important to diagnose sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage early if it is suspected.
The best first diagnostic study is a noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan
with thin imaging cuts at the brain base. If done within the first 6 hours of symptom
onset, this diagnostic test will have nearly 100% sensitivity for subarachnoid hemor-
rhage, which will then progressively decline over time. If hemorrhage is suspected
but the CT is negative, lumbar puncture should be performed as soon as possible
to assess for the presence of red cells or xanthochromia (yellowish discoloration of
cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]). This finding indicates the presence of bilirubin in the
CSF from the breakdown of hemoglobin released from lysed red blood cells and
thus differentiates subarachnoid hemorrhage from a traumatic lumbar puncture.
Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica
GCA, also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic vasculitis of large- and medium-
size vessels usually involving the cranial branches of the arteries arising from the
aortic arch. Suggestive signs and symptoms include new headache, abrupt onset of
visual disturbances, jaw claudication, fever, anemia, or elevated ESR and/or CRP in
a patient aged 50 years or older. GCA is closely related to polymyalgia rheumatica,
an inflammatory condition characterized by bilateral aching and stiffness of the
neck, torso, shoulders, or thighs, with a significantly elevated ESR. Both conditions
probably are polygenic diseases in which various environmental and genetic factors
influence susceptibility and severity. The most worrisome complication of GCA is
permanent vision loss, which can occur as an early manifestation in up to 20% of
patients. Temporal artery biopsy is recommended in all patients suspected of hav-
ing GCA. Long segments (1-2 cm) of the artery may require excision to find the
typical areas of segmental inflammation.
Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice to treat both polymyalgia rheumatica and
GCA, with daily doses of 10 to 20 mg of prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica
and 40 to 60 mg for GCA. Steroids may prevent, but usually do not reverse, visual
loss. Steroid dosage should be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy; how-
ever, relapse is common and should be suspected if symptoms return. It is also
important to consider complications of corticosteroid therapy, including hypergly-
cemia, bone loss, and neutropenia.
Migraine Headache
Migraine headache is the most common cause of clinic visits for headache because
of its frequency, disabling qualities, and associated symptoms. Migraine headache is
more common in women, and there may be a positive family history. Migraine head-
aches present with a throbbing or pulsatile quality, are usually unilateral (although
bilateral presentation does not exclude migraine), and may have a preceding aura.
Aura will typically present with temporary visual symptoms like bright shapes
but can also present with auditory or somatosensory symptoms. Other associated
symptoms include nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound. Migraines can

Case Files Internal Medicine,429,"402 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
also present with tearing or nasal congestion, which may be confused with sinus
infection. Treatment of acute episodes involves the initial use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed by triptans if symptoms persist. Preven-
tive therapies include tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, or anticonvulsants
such as valproate or topiramate.
Cluster and Tension Headaches
Episodic cluster headache is much less common but is more easily diagnosed by its
distinctive pattern. Cluster headaches are more common in men and are character-
ized by periodic attacks of intense, unilateral, periorbital pain with nasal or ocular
watering lasting minutes to hours but recurring daily over several weeks or months.
Acute attacks can be treated with oxygen or subcutaneous sumatriptan. Verapamil
is used for preventive therapy.
Tension headache is the most common type of headache. It is classically described
as a bilateral “band-like” headache that is typically nonthrobbing and does not usu-
ally have other associated symptoms like photophobia or phonophobia. Treatment
includes NSAIDs or acetaminophen and identifying and preventing headache
triggers.

38.4 A 66-year-old man is taken to the emergency department due to new-onset
seizures. He reports a severe headache over the past month and morning nau-
sea and vomiting. He also has had some difficulty with walking and balance.
On CT imaging, there is a 4-cm mass noted in the right parietal lobe of the
brain. Which of the following is the most likely cell type of this brain mass?
A. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
B. Lymphoma
C. Schwannoma
D. Medulloblastoma
ANSWERS
38.1 D. The sudden onset of severe headache with diminution in level of con-
sciousness is classic for subarachnoid hemorrhage. This patient likely had
rupture of a cerebral artery aneurysm, which is associated with polycystic
kidney disease.
38.2 E. The presence of white blood cells but no red blood cells in the CSF is
indicative of meningeal inflammation, likely due to viral or bacterial infection.
This patient would likely be admitted for IV antibiotics pending CSF culture
results.
38.3 A. The patient’s history is strongly suggestive of migraine, given its unilateral
and throbbing character, and the associated symptoms of nausea or photo-
phobia. Most patients with disabling headache have migraine. Tension head-
ache should have none of these features.
38.4 A. The most common primary brain cancer in adults is GBM. The progno-
sis unfortunately is not favorable, and a majority of individuals affected die
within 18 months. Remember that the histology of GBM shows necrosis
and pseudopallisading of cells. Most of these lesions are in the cerebrum (as
opposed to in children, where primary lesions are usually in the posterior
fossa). Answer B (lymphoma) is usually in HIV-positive patients or others
with cell-mediated immunodeficiency. Answer C (schwannoma) is a benign
tumor usually at the cerebellopontine angle and often affecting cranial nerve
VIII: hearing difficulty and tinnitus. Answer D (medulloblastoma) is of the
posterior fossa and usually affects children.

A 50-year-old man comes into the office complaining of difficulty completing his
daily duties due to increasing stiffness on the right side of his body. He states for
the last 18 months, he has felt that he had to “command his right arm” to move
and perform tasks. In fact, he started using his left arm more often. He denies
any tremors. Otherwise, he is healthy. The patient is a former college football
player and suffered multiple concussions without neurologic deficits. Both his
parents have hypertension, and his older brother was recently diagnosed with
Parkinson disease (PD). On examination, the patient appears comfortable sitting
in the examination chair. His temperature is 99 °F, heart rate is 88 beats per minute
(bpm), and blood pressure is 121/80 mm Hg. His heart and lung examinations
are unremarkable. An abdominal examination reveals normal bowel sounds
and no masses. On neurologic examination, the patient has decreased sense of
smell to lemon and coffee beans. The strength of the four extremities is normal
without atrophy or fasciculation. The patient has increased muscle tone (rigidity)
throughout, and there is difficulty with repetitive movements of his right hand.
While his equilibrium seems normal, he walks slightly bent forward at his waist,
and his right arm does not swing. Sensation is intact. Laboratory tests, including
cell count, metabolic panel, thyroid tests, rapid plasma reagin, and vitamin B
12
levels are normal.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical features of PD. (EPA 1)
2. Understand its pathophysiology and clinical course. (EPA 1, 12)
3. Outline the differential diagnosis based on presentation. (EPA 2, 3)
4. Describe the therapeutic options. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This is a 50-year-old man who has history of multiple brain concussions and com-
plains of difficulty starting movements of the right arm. He also endorses a history
of hyposmia (decreased sense of smell). On examination, there is increased rigidity
of the muscle tone throughout. Parkinson disease is a clinical diagnosis and there
are no lab biomarkers, or imaging findings that are diagnostic. The classic presen-
tation is a patient aged 55 or older with slowly progressive resting tremor and bra-
dykinesia or ridigity. This condition must be differentiated from essential tremor
and multiple sclerosis. Also Wilson disease should be considered in patients below
age 40. Because this patient is age 50, a careful history and physical examination
should be performed to decide whether further tests should be performed to inves-
tigate for secondary causes of PD. While the symptoms and signs are consistent
with PD, establishing whether this is primary or secondary is important, especially
considering the different response to dopamine agonistic (DA) drugs.

APPROACH TO:
Parkinson Disease
DEFINITIONS
AKINESIA: Difficulty initiating movements.
BRADYKINESIA: Slowness of movements.
EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYSTEM: The area of the brain including the substan-
tia nigra, striatum (includes caudate and putamen), globus pallidus, subthalamic
nucleus, and thalamus (often referred to collectively as the basal ganglia).
PARKINSON DISEASE (PD): A chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder
caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. It is
clinically diagnosed by the presence of classic symptoms, including tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia/akinesia, and postural instability (TRAP).
POSTURAL INSTABILITY: Impairment of the central postural reflexes causing a
sensation of imbalance and a tendency to fall.
PRIMARY PARKINSON DISEASE: cause of clinical findings without an identifi-
able cause and accounts for about 80-85% of cases.
SECONDARY PARKINSON: This is also called Parkinsonism and has an under-
lying etiology such as brain tumors, repeated head trauma, drugs or toxins, or other
neurological disorders.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
The etiology of PD is currently unknown. PD is estimated to affect 6.1 million
people worldwide (1 million in the United States) and is the fastest growing neu-
rologic disorder causing disability, likely due to the increasing age of the general
population. It is estimated that there are 8 to 18.6 people per 100,000 persons
diagnosed each year. A family history of the disease and older age are the most
commonly associated risk factors. Smoking, caffeine/coffee intake, exercise, ibupro-
fen, and statins have been shown to decrease overall risk. Depression is also often
linked to PD, but it is unclear if depression is a risk factor or a prodromal symptom.
For patients diagnosed prior to age 50, there is increasing evidence to suggest genetic
causes of PD. One out of every four patients with PD reports at least one first-
degree relative with the diagnosis.
Pathophysiology
Parkinson disease is caused by depletion of dopamine in the basal ganglia, leading to
the development of parkinsonian symptoms. The first three manifestations of PD
are tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Postural instability is another salient feature
that typically develops later in the disease course. The severity of the symptoms is
an independent predictor of mortality in patients. The clinical diagnosis is made
40_Toy-IM_Case39_p405-414.indd 407 03/09/20 1:56 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,435,"408 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
by having at least two of the classic symptoms of resting tremor, rigidity, bradyki-
nesia, and postural instability with a benefit from dopaminergic therapy. Diseases
that mimic PD include communicating hydrocephalus, lacunar infarcts, progres-
sive supranuclear palsy, and diffuse Lewy body disease. However, these conditions
do not respond to extended therapies of dopaminergic drugs.
Three major subtypes of PD exist: tremor dominant, akinetic/rigid dominant,
and gait difficulty or postural instability. The postural instability subtype tends to
be the most life altering and disabling. These patients tend to exhibit significant
tremor and be wheelchair-bound with a slower progression of symptoms. Parkin-
son subtypes can change as the disease progresses, making the clinical usefulness of
the classifications variable and limited.
Clinical Presentation
The most common presenting symptom of PD is the tremor, which typically
begins unilaterally in the hand and spreads contralaterally several years later.
The “pill rolling” or resting tremor of PD is 4 to 6 Hz, and is most notable when the
patient is not engaged in activities, and tends to be intermittent in the early stages
of disease. With purposeful movements, the tremor of PD lessens, distinguishing
it from other common conditions, such as essential tremor or multiple sclerosis.
As symptoms progress, the tremor may become difficult to distinguish between an
action and resting tremor.
Bradykinesia or generalized slowing of movement is present at diagnosis in 80%
of patients. Beginning distally, bradykinesia typically decreases manual dexterity,
causing difficulty with simple activities of daily living in the upper extremities and
difficulty walking in the lower extremities. Patients complain of a shuffling gait and
feelings of unsteadiness. Evaluation of limb movements should include finger, heel,
and toe tapping; hand gripping; and pronation/supination of the hands.
Increased resistance to passive motion, or rigidity, is due to increased tone.
Approximately 90% of patients exhibit some form of rigidity throughout the dis-
ease course. Classically, cogwheel rigidity can be seen when the patient demonstrates
a ratchety pattern of resistance as the limb is examined for range of motion. Addi-
tionally, patients can have “lead-pipe” rigidity with constant resistance throughout
the entire range of motion.
As PD progresses, patients develop postural instability, in which the postural
reflexes are impaired and lead to imbalance and falls. Clinicians should evaluate
patients for postural instability by standing behind the patient and pulling back
on the patient’s shoulders. This “pull” test is considered positive if the patient falls
or has to take more than one step backward to maintain balance. Early falling and
injuries should lead the clinician to consider different diseases than parkinsonian
disease, such as supranuclear palsy or multiple-system atrophy (MSA).
In addition to the four cardinal symptoms of PD, there are numerous motor and
nonmotor features of the disease. Patients often exhibit hypomimia (masked facial
expressions), impaired eye movements, blurry vision, and a shuffling gait. Meyer-
son sign, or glabellar tap sign, is the inability to suppress eyelid blink in response
to the examiner repeatedly tapping on the forehead. Nonmotor symptoms include

psychiatric symptoms such as depression, hallucinations, cognitive decline, sleep
disturbances, and olfactory dysfunction, which is called hyposmia. In a study of
over 1000 patients with PD, 97% of patients reported nonmotor symptoms, aver-
aging eight nonmotor symptoms. Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are indepen-
dent predictors of mortality in PD.
Currently, there are no diagnostic biomarkers or imaging useful for recognizing
PD. To rule out rare parkinsonian syndromes, MRI is typically obtained after PD is
suspected. According to the Movement Disorder Society, the true “gold standard”
for diagnosis is a postmortem examination of brain tissue, which would show dis-
crete, intensely eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies surrounded by a pale
halo, called Lewy bodies.

Treatment
PD has no cure. Compared to other neurodegenerative diseases, PD has more sur-
gical and pharmacologic treatments. Nearly all the available treatments only pro-
vide symptom relief and do not appear to influence the progression of the disease.
After the establishment of diagnosis, patients and medical professionals need to
determine when to start pharmacologic therapy depending on the degree of symp-
toms and their impact on quality of life. There are four main drug classes used for
the treatment of PD (Table 39–1).
Many patients develop levodopa-related complications, including motor fluc-
tuations, after 5 to 10 years of treatment. These complications are most likely due
to degenerative progression of the nigrostriatal dopamine terminals, which limits
uptake of dopamine as opposed to the initiation of treatment. However, increasing
evidence suggests that delaying treatment does not affect long-term outcomes for
PD patients. Therefore, clinicians should initiate therapy with the lowest dose of
dopaminergic medication that improves the patient’s symptoms.
Some patients with mild symptoms opt to avoid medication and its potential
side effects in the early stages of disease when the symptoms are not interfering
with everyday activities. If a patient with mild disease decides to pursue pharmaco-
logic options, monotherapy with monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors (MAO-B) or
amantadine is typically well tolerated and can effectively control symptoms.
When a patient’s quality of life begins to be affected by the motor symptoms of
PD, treatment with DAs or levodopa should be considered. The choice of therapy
is typically patient specific. Levodopa has been shown to control motor symp-
toms more effectively compared with DAs but can produce dyskinesia, especially
in younger patients. Therefore, the risk and benefits of each therapy should be
weighed when considering each patient’s symptoms and goals. PD symptoms are
highly variable, and there are no signs or symptoms to gauge the future disease bur-
den on the patient. It is estimated that 67% of individuals are disabled after 5 years
post-diagnosis, increasing to 80% at 10 years following diagnosis.
Surgical options for PD include deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Since its initial
approval in 1997, DBS has been considered when motor symptoms are not ade-
quately controlled on medications. High-frequency electrical stimulation is accom-
plished by placing thin wires in the thalamus, subthalamus, or globus pallidus
interna; an impulse generator battery is implanted under the collarbone or abdo-
men. DBS has shown improvement of the axial function without influencing
behavioral, genitive, or speech symptoms.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
39.1 A 57-year-old man is evaluated in the clinic for an 8-month history of right-
hand tremor. He has noticed that he has had difficulty signing his checks, but
that the tremor is less intense when he brushes his teeth. He denies falls, uri-
nary incontinence, or difficulty with memory. On physical examination, vital
signs are normal. His voice is low in volume, and facial expressions are nor-
mal. A low-frequency right-hand tremor is noted. Repetitive movements of
the right upper and lower extremities slow after 10 seconds. Finger-to-nose
testing reveals a bilateral tremor. Muscle tone is increased bilaterally, and you
have a difficult time moving the upper extremities passively. Gait is normal,
but arm swing is decreased. A presumptive diagnosis of PD is made. What is
the best next step to confirm the diagnosis?
A. Dopamine transporter scan
B. PARK1 genetic testing
C. MRI of the brain
D. No additional testing
39.2 A 59-year-old woman presents with 1 year of right-sided tremor. She reports
numerous falls when standing up or turning. She reports urge incontinence
and has a history of intermittent constipation. Her husband has begun sleep-
ing on the couch because the patient has been acting out her dreams at night.
On physical examination, blood pressure is 120/85 mm Hg and heart rate
66 bpm while sitting; blood pressure is 92/54 mm Hg and heart rate is 76 bpm
while standing. She has scattered ecchymosis around her extremities due to
numerous falls. A tremor is noted in her right hand with repetitive finger tap-
ping, revealing bradykinetic movements. Mild dysmetria is present with ataxic
gait. Pull test confirms postural instability. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Alcohol intoxication
B. Progressive supranuclear palsy
C. Parkinson disease

39.3 A 69-year-old man was diagnosed with PD 10 years ago. His symptoms
were initially controlled on amantadine. After worsening motor symptoms
7 years ago, carbidopa-levodopa was added, but the patient notes worsen-
ing symptoms in the past 2 years. He has tried to increase the dose and has
noticed visual hallucinations that frighten his wife. On physical examination,
vital signs are within normal limits. He has masked facies and an asymmetric
tremor at rest, with marked cogwheel rigidity. Reexamination 1 hour after
medication administration shows improvements in his symptoms. Which of
the following is the best next treatment option for this patient?
A. Deep-brain stimulation
B. Increased dose of levodopa
C. Addition of MAO-B inhibition
D. Discontinue amantadine
E. No additional interventions needed
39.4 A 45-year-old man is evaluated for depression and suicidal ideation. He
reports feelings of general disinterests for the past 5 years that have acutely
worsened with the loss of his job. He reports that his wife thinks he is more
forgetful, and he walks with small, slow steps. The patient is a former profes-
sional football player and is upset that he lacks interests in playing sports with
his kids. The patient denies medications. On physical examination, the blood
pressure is 132/64 mm Hg. During neurologic examination, he is asked to
perform rapid, alternating movements with his hands; and these maneuvers
are abnormally slowed bilaterally. He also has a shuffling gait. The patient has
a flat affect and appears to think a long time prior to answering a question. He
has difficulty with delayed recall. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Parkinson disease
B. Lewy body dementia
C. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
D. Alzheimer disease
ANSWERS
39.1 D. This is a 57 year old man who has a straightforward history suggestive of
primary PD. There does not seem to be atypical features such as hallucina-
tions, rapid disease progression, supranuclear gaze palsy, or urinary inconti-
nence. Based on the classic symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting
tremor, this patient most likely has PD. Further testing is not needed in this
patient’s situation (answers A, B, and C). While PD is a clinical diagnosis, a
very careful history and physical exam is required to assess for other potential
causes of the presenting symptoms. This can be especially difficult early in
the disease course.
40_Toy-IM_Case39_p405-414.indd 412 03/09/20 1:56 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,440,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 413
39.2 D. While this patient has many symptoms of classic PD (answer C), her early
postural instability and history of recurrent falls are atypically early in the dis-
ease. However, she has ataxia, which is not common with PD. The combina-
tion of parkinsonian symptoms with cerebellar ataxic is most consistent with
MSA or Shy-Drager syndrome. MSA has also been associated with ortho-
static hypotension and dream acting (acting out their dreams), making it the
likely diagnosis for this patient. Alcohol intoxication (answer A) should be
diagnosed by history and would be associated with slurred speech and bilat-
eral (not unilateral) symptoms. Progressive supranuclear palsy (answer B) is a
degenerative disorder of unknown etiology associated with postural instabil-
ity, falls, and ocular palsy. This patient has no eye findings; also, supranuclear
palsy is not associated with acting out dreams.
39.3 A. Deep-brain stimulation is appropriate for this patient experiencing
symptoms despite pharmacologic therapy. The patient has begun to experi-
ence medication-related complications but continues to have benefit until
the medication wears off. DBS is likely to provide control of his motor
symptoms with possible reduction in medications (not an increase, as in
answers B and C), possibly improving the medication side effects. Answer D
(amantidine) should be continued and not removed. Answer E (no addi-
tional intervention) is not indicated due the patient’s severe symptoms.
39.4 C. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is chronic traumatic encepha-
lopathy related to repetitive mild head injuries. This disease is often seen in
veterans and athletes with history of multiple concussions. This patient’s
history of playing professional football increases his risk of developing neu-
rologic symptoms. While this patient has features of PD (answer A), he
lacks the cardinal symptoms of the disease, making it less likely the diagno-
sis. Both Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease (answers B and D) are
associated with cognitive impairment and usually occur in older patients;
because of the patient’s young age and history of concussions, these demen-
tia conditions are less likely.

A 25-year-old man is being seen in the office for a 2-day history of low-grade fever
and sore throat. He is otherwise healthy and takes no regular medications. After
an evaluation, he is given an injection of intramuscular penicillin for presumed
streptococcal pharyngitis. Within a few minutes of the penicillin injection, he
begins to complain of swelling of his face and difficulty breathing. He is dyspneic
and appears frightened. His heart rate is 130 beats per minute (bpm), blood
pressure is 90/47 mm Hg, and respirations are 28 breaths per minute and shallow.
His face and lips are edematous, and he can barely open his eyes because of
swelling. He is wheezing diffusely, and he has multiple raised urticarial lesions on
his skin. Oxygen is given by face mask, and an ambulance has been called.

ANSWERS TO CASE 40:
Anaphylaxis/Drug Reactions
Summary: A 25-year-old man presents with
Facial edema and difficulty breathing minutes after receiving an injection of penicillin

Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension

Diffuse wheezing and warm skin with multiple raised urticarial lesions

Most likely diagnosis: Anaphylaxis as a result of penicillin hypersensitivity.
Next step: Immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine is the first pri-
ority; secondary measures include corticosteroids and antihistaminic H and H
1 2
blockers. Close observation of the patient’s airway and oxygenation is also impor-
tant, with possible endotracheal intubation if these becomes compromised.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the clinical presentation and emergency management of anaphylaxis.
(EPA 1, 10)
2. Understand the diagnosis and complications of serum sickness. (EPA 4, 10)
3. Recognize and treat erythema multiforme minor and major. (EPA 1, 4)
Considerations
This young man developed manifestations of immediate hypersensitivity, with
urticaria, facial angioedema, and bronchospasm. Penicillin is allergenic and leads
to an immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated release of histamines and other vasoac-
tive chemicals. Epinephrine given IM is the agent of choice in acute anaphylaxis.
The route should be intramuscular and not subcutaneous because intramuscular
injections (best in thigh) have faster and better absorption than the subcutane-
ous route. Epinephrine improves tissue edema by causing vasoconstriction. Anti-
histamines may also help. Because the airway is vulnerable to compromise as a
result of severe edema, intubation to protect the airway is sometimes indicated.
Meanwhile, measures should be taken to calm the patient and help to slow their
respirations. Pulse oximetry is important. Because different ambulances have dif-
ferent capabilities, it is important to ask for emergency medical services for pos-
sible airway obstruction.

APPROACH TO:
Anaphylaxis
DEFINITIONS
ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS: Similar clinical picture to anaphylaxis with
cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal symptoms but not caused
by immunologic mechanisms (eg, adverse reaction to iodinated contrast material).
ANAPHYLAXIS: Syndrome with varied mechanisms, clinical presentations, and
severity that is an acute life-threatening reaction resulting from a type I hypersen-
sitivity reaction (HSR), which is an IgE-mediated activation of mast cells. Mast cell
degranulation results in release of histamine, interleukins, and other inflammatory
mediators.
ANGIOEDEMA: Swelling of the lips, periorbital region, face, hands, or feet.
ARTHUS REACTION: An example of a type III HSR caused by the development
of antigen-antibody immune complexes at the local site of injection of antigens into
the skin, which presents with hemorrhage and significant edema.
TYPE I HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: IgE-mediated allergic response to
environmental antigens.
TYPE II HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: IgM- or IgG-mediated damage to
cells by either phagocytosis or activation of complement. Examples include autoim-
mune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic disease of
the fetus and the newborn, and Goodpasture syndrome.
TYPE III HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: IgM- or IgG-mediated reaction
with soluble antigens to form antibody-antigen complexes. The complexes activate
complement, leading to release of chemotactic factors to attract neutrophils and
induce inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. Examples include serum sick-
ness and Arthus reaction.
TYPE IV HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION: Mediated by T cells and mono-
cytes and/or macrophages. Symptoms take a few days to manifest. Also referred to
as delayed-type or cell-mediated HSR. Examples include the tuberculin skin test
and poison ivy exposure.
URTICARIA: Heterogeneous, self-resolving skin reaction presenting with pruritic
wheals characterized by central swelling and epidermal erythema surrounding the
wheals. It usually takes about 24 hours but can take up to 48 hours to resolve with-
out scarring the skin.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Common causes of anaphylaxis include drugs, Hymenoptera stings (bees, wasps),
radiographic contrast media (anaphylactoid), blood products, latex in medical
41_Toy-IM_Case40_p415-424.indd 417 02/09/20 6:53 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,445,"418 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
products, allergen immunotherapy injections, and foods. The most common cause
of drug-related anaphylaxis is beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin. The most
common cause of food-related anaphylaxis is peanuts, partly because of the fre-
quency with which peanut products are included in other types of foods. In fact,
peanut allergy has doubled in incidence in Western countries. A recent randomized
trial suggested that introducing peanut products before the age of 1 seemed to
decrease the development of peanut allergy (13.7% control vs 1.9% early exposure).
It is important to note that almost any agent that can activate mast cells or baso-
phils can cause an anaphylactic reaction. Approximately one-third of all cases of
anaphylaxis are idiopathic.
History of Penicillin Allergy. Penicillin is the most common medication associ-
ated with anaphylaxis, reported by 10% of patients. Many reported “allergies” are
actually adverse effects such as rashes or nausea and not IgE-mediated immediate
hypersensitivity. Over time, individuals with true penicillin allergy may no longer
have reactions. Careful history taking is important when a patient reports a
penicillin allergy, including whether there were hives, throat tightening, swelling of
the lips or mouth, or difficulty breathing. When the use of penicillin is critical and
the history is unclear, the use of skin testing may be helpful.
When a patient reports a history highly suggestive of anaphylaxis, penicillin
and cephalosporins should be avoided. When the history is suggestive of a non-
IgE adverse effect, then a beta-lactam may be used, especially cephalosporin (since
there is only about 10% cross-reactivity). When the history is unclear, penicillin skin
testing may be helpful. If skin testing is unavailable, penicillin generally should be
avoided, but cephalosporins are probably acceptable given the small cross-reactivity.
When penicillin is the only choice in someone with known previous allergic reac-
tions, desensitization protocols administered by pharmacists are viable options.
This is the case for pregnant women or patients with AIDS in need of treatment
for neurosyphilis.
Differential Diagnosis. Other considerations in the differential diagnosis of
anaphylaxis include erythema multiforme major and minor. Erythema multi-
forme minor often occurs after herpes simplex virus (HSV) or other infections.
It manifests as urticarial or bullous skin lesions. The pathognomonic finding is a
target lesion, described as a lesion that is centrally inflamed but is surrounded by
an area of less inflamed skin. Treatment includes management of the underlying
cause when known, withdrawal of suspected causative drugs, and acyclovir if HSV
involvement is suspected. Erythema multiforme major (Stevens-Johnson syndrome
[SJS]) is similar to erythema multiforme minor but is more severe and involves
two or more mucosal surfaces. It is also more likely to be induced by drugs such
as sulfonamides or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Skin find-
ings may include petechiae, vesicles, bullae, and some desquamation of the skin. If
the epidermal detachment involves less than 10% of the skin, it is considered SJS.
If the epidermal detachment involves more than 30% of the skin, it is considered
toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Between 10-30% skin affected is considered the
SJS/TEN overlap condition. Other symptoms include fever, headache, malaise,
arthralgias, corneal ulcerations, arrhythmias, pericarditis, electrolyte abnormalities,
seizures, coma, and sepsis.
41_Toy-IM_Case40_p415-424.indd 418 02/09/20 6:53 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,446,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 419
Treatment involves withdrawal of the suspected offending agent, treatment of
concurrent infections, aggressive fluid resuscitation and maintenance, and support-
ive treatment similar to burn care. Use of corticosteroids is controversial, but they
are often prescribed.
Other Types of Drug Reactions. Most drug rashes are maculopapular and occur
several days after starting treatment with an offending drug. They usually are not
associated with other signs and symptoms, and they resolve several days after
removal of the offending agent. Serum sickness, on the other hand, is an allergic
reaction that occurs 7 to 10 days after primary administration, or 2 to 4 days after
secondary administration, of a foreign serum or a drug (ie, a heterologous protein
or a nonprotein drug). It is characterized by fever, polyarthralgia, urticaria, lymph-
adenopathy, and sometimes glomerulonephritis. It is a type III HSR, caused by
the formation of immune complexes of IgG and the offending antigen. Treatment
is based on symptomatology, as the disease usually is self-limiting. Treatment may
include administration of antihistamines, aspirin, or NSAIDs and therapy for the
underlying disease.
Finally, several other types of drug reactions do not fit into the categories dis-
cussed. Two of the most important types are iodine allergy and anticonvulsant
drug hypersensitivity. “Iodine allergy” is often associated with radiologic contrast
media. Reactions to contrast media are the result of the hyperosmolar dye causing
degranulation of mast cells and basophils rather than a true allergic reaction. These
reactions can be prevented by pretreatment with diphenhydramine, H blockers,
2
and corticosteroids beginning 12 hours before the procedure. There is no evidence
that a history of seafood allergy is related to adverse events from radiocontrast
media. Phenytoin and other aromatic anticonvulsants have been associated with a
hypersensitivity syndrome characterized by a severe idiosyncratic reaction, includ-
ing rash and fever, often with associated hepatitis, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy,
or hematologic abnormalities. The skin manifestations can range from skin rash to
TEN. This reaction is not IgE mediated, and the exact mechanism remains unclear.
Treatment is supportive, with withdrawal of the offending agent.
Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of anaphylactic reactions varies greatly, but the follow-
ing guidelines are a good rule of thumb. Symptoms usually develop within 5 to
60 minutes following exposure, although a delayed reaction is possible. Symptoms
and signs are variable and are listed in Table 40–1. The key fact to remember is
Table 40–1 • CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF ANAPHYLAXIS
Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, hypotension, tachycardia
Dermatologic: Angioedema, cyanosis, flushing, pruritis, urticaria
Gastrointestinal: Abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting
Neurologic: Dizziness, seizures, syncope, weakness
Pulmonary: Bronchorrhea, dizziness, dyspnea, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, stridor,
tachypnea, wheezing
Other: Diaphoresis, hoarseness, laryngeal edema, sense of impending doom
41_Toy-IM_Case40_p415-424.indd 419 02/09/20 6:53 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,447,"420 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
that a true anaphylactic reaction is life threatening. Angioedema may occur with or
without urticaria but is not anaphylaxis unless the reaction is associated with other
life threatening processes, such as hypotension or laryngeal edema.
Treatment
Treatment of anaphylaxis begins with first assessing the ABCs (airway, breathing,
circulation). Intubation, if required, should not be delayed. Second, epinephrine
should be administered to help control symptoms and blood pressure. Epineph-
rine acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors and induces vasoconstriction, thus revers-
ing peripheral vasodilation induced by inflammatory mediators and alleviating
hypotension, angioedema, erythema, and urticaria. Epinephrine also acts on beta-
adrenergic receptors, inducing bronchodilation, preventing further mast cell and
basophil release of inflammatory mediators, and increasing myocardial contractil-
ity and cardiac output. Intramuscular epinephrine injected in the anterolateral thigh
(vastus lateralis) leads to more rapid and higher peak levels than do subcutaneous
or deltoid intramuscular injection. High doses of epinephrine are recommended
because low doses can lead to increased release of inflammatory mediators, vasodi-
lation, and hypotension. Intravenous epinephrine is reserved for patients with ana-
phylaxis unresponsive to intramuscular administration due to risk of myocardial
infarction and fatal arrhythmias.
Corticosteroids are also frequently used in the treatment of anaphylaxis. Their
role is unclear, but studies have shown that they decrease length of hospitaliza-
tion, although they do not reduce the number of visits to the emergency depart-
ment. The benefits of corticosteroids are thought to include inhibition of platelet
and neutrophil aggregation and synthesis of inflammatory mediators, as well as
increased response to beta-adrenergic agonists.
Additional treatment measures include placing the patient in a recumbent position,
elevating the legs, administration of oxygen as needed, normal saline (NS) volume
replacement and/or use of vasopressors as required, and administration of diphen-
hydramine 50 mg orally or intravenously every 4 hours as needed (Table 40–2).

ANSWERS
40.1 A. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often associated
with angioedema. Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitors can occur at any
subsequent point during use, not solely after the initial doses. Reactions to
exogenous agents such as soap (answer B) typically result from a type IV
HSR and usually present as a skin rash. Causes of anaphylactic reactions
include drugs (answer D) and food (answer E). A true anaphylactic reaction
is life threatening; it may present with angioedema with or without urticaria,
but it also presents with other life threatening processes, such as hypotension.
Drug allergies may present as an anaphylactic reaction or a drug rash; most
drug rashes are maculopapular and occur several days after starting treatment
with an offending drug and resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Hypo-
thyroidism (answer C) is an autoimmune disease process most commonly
caused by autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and/or
TSH receptors.
40.2 B. This is a common presentation of hypersensitivity syndrome associated
with aromatic anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital).
Poison ivy (answer A) is not associated with fever and lymphadenopathy.
Lyme disease (answer D) is associated with erythema migrans, an erythema-
tous annular rash with a central clearing (target lesion) developing within
days of infection. HIV (answer C) is a less likely answer considering that a
history of risk factors is not being presented.
40.3 D. This patient has developed airway obstruction due to an anaphylactic
reaction. He requires intubation and mechanical ventilation to maintain
oxygenation. The first step in treating anaphylaxis is assessing the ABCs.
Intubation, if required, should not be delayed. Second, epinephrine (answer B)
should be administered to help control symptoms and blood pressure.
Additional treatment measures include placing the patient in a recumbent
position, elevating the legs, administration of oxygen as needed (answer C),
NS volume replacement and/or use of vasopressors as required, and adminis-
tration of diphenhydramine 50 mg orally or intravenously every 4 hours as
needed (answer A). Electrical cardioversion (answer E) is not indicated in
the treatment of anaphylaxis.
41_Toy-IM_Case40_p415-424.indd 422 02/09/20 6:53 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,450,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 423
40.4 D. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine, H blockers, and corticosteroids
2
beginning 12 hours before the procedure greatly decreases the reaction to
contrast dye. For patients presenting with clinical indication for rapid imag-
ing, premedication should be given at least 5 hours prior to contrast admin-
istration (answer B). Therefore, there is no need to cancel the procedure
and proceed with surgery (answer C). Desensitization (answer A) is not an
appropriate treatment course since radiocontrast allergy is not a true allergic
reaction.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Anaphylaxis is characterized by respiratory distress caused by broncho-
»
spasm, cutaneous manifestations such as urticaria or angioedema, and
gastrointestinal hypermotility. Patients may die as a consequence of air-
way compromise or vascular collapse caused by widespread vasodilation.
Treatment of anaphylaxis is immediate epinephrine, antihistamines, air-
»
way protection, and blood pressure support as necessary. Corticosteroids
may help prevent late recurrence of symptoms.
Epinephrine is the immediate drug of choice in treating anaphylaxis.
»
Serum sickness is an immune complex-mediated disease that may
»
include fever, cutaneous eruptions, lymphadenopathy, arthritis, and glo-
merulonephritis. It usually is self-limited, but treatment may be necessary
for renal complications.
Erythema multiforme minor is characterized by urticarial or bullous
»
eruptions, often with target lesions, usually following HSV infections. Ery-
thema multiforme major (SJS) usually is caused by drugs and includes
cutaneous and mucosal involvement.

An 84-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance
from her long-term care facility for increased confusion, combativeness, and
fever. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease and well-controlled
hypertension. The patient is “confused” and combative with the staff, which, per
her family, is not her baseline mental status. Her temperature is 100.5 °F, heart rate
is 130 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 76/32 mm Hg, respiratory rate is
24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. On examination,
she is lethargic but agitated when disturbed, her neck veins are flat, her lung fields
are clear, and her heart rhythm is regular and tachycardic without murmur or
gallops. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, and her extremities are warm
and pink.
After administration of 2 L of normal saline over 60 minutes, her blood pressure
is 95/58 mm Hg. The initial laboratory work returns. Her white blood cell count
(WBC) is 14,000/mm3, with 67% neutrophils, 3% bands, and 24% lymphocytes.
Serum lactate is 3 mmol/L. No other abnormalities are noted. A chest x-ray
obtained in the emergency department is normal. Urinalysis shows 2+ leukocyte
esterase, negative nitrites, and trace blood. Microscopy shows 20 to 50 white
blood cells per high-power field, 0 to 3 red blood cells, and many bacteria.

ANSWERS TO CASE 41:
Urinary Tract Infection With Sepsis in the Elderly
Summary: An 84-year-old woman presents to the emergency department from
her nursing home with
History of Alzheimer disease

Agitation, confusion, low grade fever, tachycardia, and hypotension

Flat veins, clear lung fields, no cardiac murmur or gallops, and warm and well-

perfused extremities on physical examination
Improved hemodynamic status with a fluid bolus

Evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) on laboratory examination

Most likely diagnosis: Septic shock secondary to a UTI.
Next step: Continued blood pressure support with intravenous (IV) fluids or vaso-
pressors as necessary. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started as soon as
possible.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Explain how to diagnose a UTI. (EPA 3)
2. List effective treatments for a UTI. (EPA 4)
3. Describe the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria. (EPA 4)
4. Identify and treat septic shock. (EPA 1, 10)
5. Describe goal-oriented therapy of septic shock. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
This elderly woman with Alzheimer disease presents with shock, that is, hypo-
tension leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. It is essential to determine the
underlying cause and thus initiate appropriate treatment. She has no history
or physical examination findings suggestive of hemorrhage or extreme volume
losses, so hypovolemic shock is unlikely. She has flat neck veins and clear lung
fields, suggesting she does not have right or left heart failure, respectively, so car-
diogenic shock (eg, after a myocardial infarction) seems unlikely. Additionally,
both hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock typically cause profound peripheral
vasoconstriction, resulting in cold, clammy extremities. This patient’s extremi-
ties are warm and well perfused (inappropriately so) despite serious hypotension,
suggesting a distributive form of shock (early septic shock). Older patients may
not be able to mount a high fever; importantly, an afebrile patient does not rule
out sepsis. With the elevated WBC count with immature forms as well as the
urine findings, septic shock as a consequence of UTI seems most likely.

APPROACH TO:
UTI with Sepsis
DEFINITIONS
ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA: A condition in which urine Gram stain or
culture is positive, but no clinical signs or symptoms of infection are present. This
condition is rarely requires treatment unless the patient is a pregnant woman or
immunocompromised (eg, transplant recipients).
CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: Shock due to intracardiac conditions leading to
decreased cardiac output, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and valvular
insufficiencies.
DISTRIBUTIVE SHOCK: Shock characterized by peripheral vasodilation (ie,
decreased systemic vascular resistance). It is divided into the following types: ana-
phylactic shock (caused by a severe type I hypersensitivity reaction); endocrine
shock (caused by an underlying endocrine disease, eg, adrenal failure or myx-
edema); neurogenic shock (caused by trauma to the central nervous system); and
septic shock (caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection).
HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK: Shock due to volume depletion causing decreased
intravascular volume, which leads to a compensatory increase in systemic vascular
resistance in an attempt to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Caused by hemor-
rhagic (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding) and nonhemorrhagic (eg, dehydration, third-
spacing) etiologies.
OBSTRUCTIVE SHOCK: Shock due to extracardiac conditions leading to
decreased cardiac output, such as pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax,
and pericardial tamponade.
SEPSIS: A life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction due to dysregulated host
response to an infection.
SEPSIS SCORING SYSTEMS: There are various sepsis scoring systems such as
SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score or simplified qSOFA (quick
SOFA) that attempts to estimate morbidity or mortality risk due to sepsis.
SEPTIC SHOCK: Subset of sepsis with circulatory and metabolic/cellular dys-
function that is associated with a higher mortality risk.
SHOCK: A life-threatening condition due to circulatory failure leading to hypo-
tension and thus inadequate oxygen delivery to and utilization by tissues. There are
four main categories: cardiogenic, distributive, hypovolemic, and obstructive shock.
SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SYNDROME (SIRS): Criteria that
illustrate systemic inflammation that may or may not indicate underlying infection.
The criteria include temperature deviation (> 38 °C or < 36 °C), tachypnea (respira-
tory rate > 20 breaths per minute or Paco < 32 mm Hg), tachycardia (heart rate
2
> 90 bpm), and leukocyte shifts with WBC > 12,000/mm3 or < 4000/mm3 or > 10%
immature forms (bands).

CLINICAL APPROACH TO UTI
Epidemiology
UTIs are a common affliction of the elderly, affecting both debilitated and healthy
adults. UTIs are second only to respiratory infections as the most common infections
in patients older than 65 years. Risk factors that contribute to the high incidence
of UTIs in the elderly, as well as in institutionalized patients, include incontinence,
a history of prior UTIs, neurologic impairment, immunosuppression, poor nutri-
tion, and comorbid disease states. These conditions may confer functional abnor-
malities within the urinary tract or altered defenses against infection. Furthermore,
frequent hospitalizations expose these patients to nosocomial pathogens and inva-
sive instrumentation, such as indwelling catheters.
Pathophysiology
Most UTIs occur as one of three clinical syndromes: acute uncomplicated cystitis
(lower tract infection), acute pyelonephritis (upper tract infection), or catheter-
associated UTI (in hospitalized, institutionalized, or neurogenic bladder patients).
Symptoms of cystitis reflect bladder irritation and generally include dysuria,
increased frequency, urgency, or hematuria. Pyelonephritis typically presents with
systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or nausea; flank pain; and findings of WBC
casts on urinalysis. Catheter-associated UTI can be diagnosed by fever, suprapubic
pain, or other symptoms attributable to infection, along with a positive urine cul-
ture in patients with permanent or intermittent catheterization of the urinary tract.
Another common situation that deserves mention is asymptomatic bacteriuria.
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is characterized by positive urine culture without clini-
cal symptoms. Outside of pregnancy or immunocompromised patients such as
transplant recipients, no adverse clinical outcomes have been reported as a result of
asymptomatic bacteriuria, and no benefits of treatment have been demonstrated.
Diagnostic Criteria. UTIs typically are diagnosed based on a combination of
symptoms and urinary findings. In symptomatic patients, bacteria typically are
found in high concentrations in the urine, and 105 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL
typically are recovered from a clean-catch specimen. If the specimen is obtained by
catheterization, finding more than 102 CFU/mL is considered significant. In women
with symptoms of acute cystitis (such as dysuria, frequency, and urinary tenesmus),
urine cultures are often not obtained, but empiric treatment can be initiated based
on the dipstick findings of leukocyte esterase (used as a marker for pyuria) or nitrites
(produced by some bacteria that cause UTIs).
Clinical Presentation
Fever, dysuria, urgency, or flank pain may be presenting symptoms for a UTI in
younger patients. However, elderly and institutionalized patients often present
with less obvious symptoms. These patients may be febrile or hypothermic. Com-
mon manifestations include confusion or combativeness. Mental status or behav-
ioral changes in the elderly should be considered strong indicators for serious illness,
and a thorough workup should consider etiologies beyond infections. Even with
localizing symptoms suggestive of a UTI, other sources of infection should still

be investigated. Both urine and blood cultures should be obtained in addition to
a urinalysis and complete blood count (CBC). The results of the urine and blood
cultures may take 2 to 3 days to yield an organism. If the clinical picture suggests a
UTI and sepsis, antibiotic treatment should be initiated immediately. Empiric anti-
microbial therapy can be directed at the most common pathogens (Table 41–1).
Treatment
For uncomplicated cystitis, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones
such as ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin are acceptable first-line therapies and
are typically given for 3 days. Empiric therapy should be guided by knowledge of
local antibiotic resistance patterns. Similar empiric treatment may be initiated for
pyelonephritis, but urine and blood cultures should be obtained. Treatment is then
guided by culture results and should be continued for 10 to 14 days. Catheter-
associated UTI can only be diagnosed with a positive culture (the sample should be
obtained from a new catheter, or the catheter port, but not the drainage bag), and
antibiotic therapy is tailored to the identified pathogen. If possible, the catheter
should be removed or replaced. Bacteria commonly secrete a biofilm in which they
embed, making the full sterilization of the urine less likely.
Elderly and institutionalized patients commonly acquire gram-positive and
mixed infections, so broad-spectrum antibiotics pending culture results are recom-
mended. In patients presenting with a clinical picture of sepsis, broad-spectrum
antibiotic coverage against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, includ-
ing antipseudomonal activity, is recommended until cultures are available to guide
therapy. The duration of therapy should be dictated by the patient’s clinical status.
In cases where UTIs have progressed to bacteremia, aggressive and prompt treat-
ment is necessary to prevent the onset of septic shock. This life-threatening state
may develop with little warning in elderly and institutionalized patients with mul-
tiple comorbidities, as it did in the patient in the case, who presented with hypoten-
sion and altered mental status because of infection, that is in septic shock.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO SHOCK
Pathophysiology
Shock is the clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. It can
be classified in a variety of ways, but one useful schema divides the causes into
hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock, usually caused by
sepsis. Hypovolemic shock is the most common form. It results from either hemor-
rhage or profound vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in loss of 20% to 40% of blood
volume. Cardiogenic shock results from a primary cardiac insult, such as a myo-
cardial infarction, arrhythmia, or end-stage systolic heart failure. Both hypovole-
mic and cardiogenic shock cause a marked fall in cardiac output and may appear
clinically similar with tachycardia, hypotension, and cold, clammy extremities. It
is essential to differentiate between the two, however, because the treatments are
markedly different. Patients with hypovolemic shock should have flat neck veins
and clear lung fields; those with cardiogenic shock are more likely to have markedly
elevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary edema.
Distributive shock, in contrast, is characterized by an increase in cardiac output
but an inability to maintain systemic vascular resistance, that is, there is inappro-
priate vasodilation. Clinically, it appears different from the other forms of shock in
that, despite the hypotension, the extremities are warm and well perfused, at least
initially. If septic shock continues, cardiac output falls as a consequence of myocar-
dial depression, multiorgan dysfunction ensues, and intense vasoconstriction occurs
in an attempt to maintain blood pressure, the so-called cold phase. These findings
portend a poor prognosis; hence, prompt recognition of septic shock in the early
(warm) phase is paramount.
Although distributive shock may occur in neurogenic shock as a consequence
of spinal cord injury or adrenal crisis, the most common cause is septic shock, with
the most common infectious etiologies of sepsis being UTIs and pneumonia. Septic
shock is associated with high 30-day mortality rates, exceeding 50%. Early diagno-
sis and prompt treatment are imperative because untreated shock progresses to an
irreversible point that is refractory to volume expansion and other medical thera-
pies. The qSOFA score is a rapid, bedside assessment of three variables: Glasgow
Coma Score (≤ 14), systolic blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg), and respiratory rate
(> 22 breaths per minute). The presence of two of those three is associated with
high mortality.
New Terminology. In 2016, the International Sepsis Consensus Conference
(Sepsis-3) recommended deemphasizing the use of SIRS (nonspecific) and instead
adopting SOFA as a more accurate prognostic indicator of the effects of sepsis.
Their recommendation is that a total SOFA score of two or more points from base-
line represents organ dysfunction; however, the SOFA scores are research tools and
have not yet been validated widely in clinical practice.
Treatment
Treatment of hypovolemic shock is aggressive volume resuscitation, either with
crystalloid solution or with blood products, as necessary. Treatment of cardiogenic
shock focuses on maintaining blood pressure with dopamine or norepinephrine
42_Toy-IM_Case41_p425-434.indd 430 03/09/20 9:06 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,458,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 431
infusions, relief of pulmonary edema with diuretics, and reducing cardiac afterload,
for example, with an intra-aortic balloon pump.
The initial treatment for distributive shock is isotonic fluid resuscitation to
maintain adequate intravascular volume. Other cornerstones of therapy include
broad-spectrum antibiotics targeted to the underlying infection and removing the
source of the infection. Patients often require vasopressor support (norepinephrine
is the agent of choice) and mechanical ventilation to optimize tissue oxygenation.
Vasopressors increase systemic vascular resistance via vasoconstriction to increase
organ perfusion. The three main subtypes are catecholamine–, smooth muscle–,
and dopaminergic receptor–targeting vasopressors. Catecholamine vasopressors
target the alpha and/or beta receptors and include phenylephrine, norepinephrine,
and epinephrine. Vasopressin acts on smooth muscle V-1 receptors and renal V-2
receptors for vasoconstrictive and antidiuretic uses, respectively; it has no iono-
tropic or chronotropic effects. Dopamine acts on dopaminergic, alpha, and beta
receptors in a dose-dependent manner. IV hydrocortisone may be administered to
patients with hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.

collaborative that develops evidence-based guidelines on reducing morbidity and

ANSWERS
41.1 B. All these patients are asymptomatic, and no benefit from treatment in
terms of reduction in hospitalization has been shown for any of the cases
mentioned, except for pregnancy. Treatment is undertaken to prevent upper
UTI, preterm delivery, and possible fetal loss.
41.2 C. The patient in this scenario has symptoms of an upper UTI (eg, pyelo-
nephritis) and is moderately ill with nausea. She will need a 14-day course
of treatment and may not be able to take oral antibiotics initially, so hospi-
talization and treatment with IV antibiotics likely will be necessary. Single-
dose (answer B) and 3-day (answer A) regimens are useful only for acute
uncomplicated cystitis in women. E. coli is frequently resistant to ampicillin
(answer D).
41.3 C. The patient is a middle-aged man who presents with shortness of breath
and light-headedness. He is hypotensive with signs of left and right heart
failure, that is, probably cardiogenic shock. The findings of pulmonary crack-
les and jugular venous distension are consistent with right heart failure; the
presence of arterial hypotension and cold and clammy extremities is consis-
tent with left heart failure. The most common cause of acute heart failure
would be myocardial infarction, even in the absence of chest pain. Septic shock
(answer A) and adrenal crisis (answer B) both are forms of distributive shock
that would produce warm extremities. Hypovolemic shock (answer D) would
present with flat neck veins, no pulmonary edema, and often a history of
trauma, diarrhea, or blood loss.
41.4 D. When septic shock is refractory to volume resuscitation with isotonic
fluid of at least 30 mL/kg of ideal body weight administration, the next step
is adding a vasopressive agent (currently the favored medication is IV nor-
epinephrine). Corticosteroids (answer B) can be administered, empirically
if hypotension is refractory to vasopressors; steroids have fallen in and out
of favor, but the most current evidence seems to indicate its positive effects.
However, steroids are an adjunct and not primary therapy. IV morphine
(answer E) might lower his blood pressure further. FFP (answer C) is used
when the patient shows evidence of coagulopathy such as disseminated intra-
vascular coagulation. Answer A (beta-blocking agent) is not indicated since
this patient’s tachycardia is in response to the hypotension and not a primary
cardiac arrhythmia.

A 24-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a
fever with shaking chills for the past 12 hours. He is currently being treated
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His most recent chemotherapy session
with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and
dexamethasone was 7 days ago. He denies any cough or dyspnea, headache,
abdominal pain, or diarrhea. He has had no sick contacts or recent travel. On
physical examination, he is febrile to 103 °F and tachycardic with a heart rate of
122 beats per minute (bpm). His blood pressure is 118/65 mm Hg, and respiratory
rate is 22 breaths per minute. He is ill appearing; his skin is warm and moist but
without any rashes. His chest is clear to auscultation. His heart rate is regular with
a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border. The abdominal examination is
benign. The perirectal area is normal. The digital rectal examination is deferred,
and his stool is negative for occult blood. He has a tunneled vascular catheter at
the right internal jugular vein without erythema overlying the subcutaneous tract
or purulent discharge at the catheter exit site. He states he flushes the catheter
each day and that yesterday he experienced a 20- to 30-minute episode of shaking
chills about 10 minutes after flushing the catheter. Laboratory studies reveal a
total white blood cell (WBC) count of 1100 cells/mm3, with a differential of 10%

Vascular Catheter Infection in a Patient With
Neutropenic Fever
Summary: A 24-year-old man presents with
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

Fever of 103 °F

History of immunosuppressive chemotherapy 7 days ago

ANC of 286/mm3

Central venous catheter (CVC) with history suggestive of possible infection

Most likely diagnosis: Neutropenic fever and possible vascular catheter infection;
the high suspicion for these diagnoses is due to the symptomatic chills after the
flushing of a catheter in a cancer patient with neutropenia.
Next therapeutic step: Blood cultures should be drawn on this patient, ideally
simultaneously from the catheter and a peripheral vein. Immediately afterward,
the patient should undergo broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic administration,
including coverage for gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus spp. The vas-
cular catheter should be removed, if possible.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the possible sources of infection in a neutropenic patient. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Discuss the management of a patient with neutropenic fever. (EPA 4)
3. Explain how to diagnose and treat a catheter-related infection. (EPA 3, 4)
4. Describe the strategies to prevent infection in immunosuppressed patients,
including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and vaccination of
household contacts. (EPA 4, 12)
Considerations
This patient is being treated for a hematologic malignancy with combination che-
motherapy, which has a common side effect of leukopenia, especially neutropenia.
Generally, the nadir of the white cell count occurs 7 to 14 days after the chemother-
apy. This patient has neutropenia, defined as an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3. The
ANC is calculated by neutrophil percent multiplied by total WBC count. Infection
in this immunosuppressed condition is life threatening, and immediate antibiotic
coverage is paramount. Neutropenic patients are at risk for a variety of bacterial,
fungal, or viral infections, but the most common sources of infection are the skin
or oral cavity (gram-positive bacteria) and the bowel (gram-negative bacteria).
Because of the absence of WBCs, the patient may not manifest the cardinal
43_Toy-IM_Case42_p435-442.indd 436 03/09/20 9:51 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,464,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 437
inflammatory signs. The spectrum of coverage of empirical antibiotics should
include enterobacteria, Pseudomonas species, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) should also be considered in
neutropenic patients with skin infections, pneumonia, suspected indwelling cath-
eter infections, or sepsis. Rapid initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy is critical
while attempts to find a source of infection are in progress.
APPROACH TO:
Neutropenic Fever
DEFINITIONS
CENTRAL LINE–ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTION (CLABSI):
A primary bloodstream infection (ie, there is no apparent infection at another site)
that develops in a patient with a central line in place within the 48-hour period
before onset of the bloodstream infection that is not related to infection at another
site. Culturing the catheter tip or peripheral blood is not a criterion for CLABSI.
CATHETER-RELATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTION (CRBSI): The pres-
ence of bacteremia originating from an intravenous catheter.
CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER: A CVC is a catheter that is inserted into a
large vein such as the subclavian, internal jugular, or femoral vein.
FEVER: Single oral temperature measurement greater than or equal to 101 °F
(38.3 °C) or a temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) for 1 hour
or more.
MUCOSITIS: Breakdown of skin and mucosal barriers as a result of chemotherapy
or radiation. Mucositis can result in bacteremia or fungemia.
NEUTROPENIA: ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3. It is considered severe when
the number is lower than 500 cells/mm3.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Fever in a neutropenic patient with cancer should be considered a medical emergency.
Approximately 5% to 10% of cancer patients will die of neutropenia-associated
infection. Individuals with a hematologic malignancy (leukemias or lymphomas)
are at an even greater risk for sepsis as a result of lymphocyte or granulocyte dys-
function or because of abnormal immunoglobulin production. Chemotherapy often
causes further bone marrow suppression and neutropenia. The incidence of an
occult infection in a neutropenic patient increases with the severity and duration of
the neutropenia (high risk if > 7-10 days, and especially if ANC < 100 cells/mm3).
Some neutropenic patients (eg, the elderly or those receiving corticosteroids) may
not be able to mount a febrile response to infection; thus, any neutropenic patient
showing signs of clinical deterioration should be suspected of having sepsis.
43_Toy-IM_Case42_p435-442.indd 437 03/09/20 9:51 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,465,"438 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
CVCs are in widespread use and are common sites of infection in hospi-
talized patients and patients receiving outpatient infusion therapy. Infection
may occur as a consequence of contamination by gram-positive skin flora or by
hematogenous seeding, usually by enteric gram-negative organisms or Candida
spp. Erythema, purulent drainage, and induration are signs of infection.
In the absence of obvious tunnel or exit-site infection, authorities recommend
obtaining two or more blood cultures to try to diagnose catheter-related bactere-
mia, with at least one from the CVC. Catheter-related infection is suspected when
a patient has two or more positive blood cultures obtained from a peripheral vein;
clinical manifestations of infection (eg, fever, chills, and/or hypotension); and no
alternative apparent source of bloodstream infection. In some institutions, quanti-
tative blood cultures (counting colony-forming units [CFUs]) are obtained under
the assumption that a four-fold higher colony count will be obtained from blood
drawn from an infected catheter than blood drawn from a peripheral vein, support-
ing the diagnosis of catheter-related bacteremia. A blood culture that is drawn from
the CVC that becomes positive at least 20 minutes before the peripheral blood cul-
tures is an indication that the CVC is the likely source of infection. If the catheter
is removed, the tip of the catheter may be cut off and rolled across a culture plate,
using a quantitative culture method.
Clinical Presentation
The typical signs and symptoms of infection noted in immunocompetent patients
are the result of the host’s inflammatory response. This may be minimal or absent
in neutropenic patients. Soft tissue infections may have diminished or absent indu-
ration, erythema, or purulence; pneumonia may not show discernible radiologic
infiltrates; meningitis may not reveal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis; and
urinary tract infection may be present without pyuria. Infected catheters may
manifest as an infection of the subcutaneous tunnel, infection at the exit site, or
catheter-related bacteremia and sepsis.
Treatment
Empiric antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly to all neutropenic
patients at the onset of fever. Historically, gram-negative bacilli, mainly enteric flora,
were the most common pathogens in these patients. Empiric coverage for gram-
negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is almost always indicated for
neutropenic fever. Early treatment is associated with reduced mortality. Currently,
as a consequence of frequent use of CVCs, gram-positive bacteria account for 60%
to 70% of microbiologically documented infections. Another clue that the infection
is likely to be a gram-positive organism includes the presence of obvious soft tissue
infections, such as cellulitis or oral mucositis. This causes breaks in the mucosal
barriers and allows oral flora to enter the bloodstream. If any of these factors is
present, an appropriate agent, such as vancomycin, should be added to the regimen.
If patients continue to be febrile despite antibacterial therapy, empiric antifungal
therapy should be considered. Figure 42–1 shows a useful algorithm for patient
management.

Catheter-Related Infection. The two main decisions impacting suspected catheter-
related infection are (1) whether the catheter is really the source of infection
and, if it is, and (2) must the catheter be removed or can the infection be cleared
with antibiotic therapy alone? Most nontunneled or implanted catheters should
be removed. For more permanent catheters, the decision to remove the catheter
depends on the patient’s clinical state, identification of the organism, and the pres-
ence of complications, such as endocarditis or septic venous thrombosis.
S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus are the most common causes of
catheter-associated infections. For coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia,
response to antibiotic therapy without catheter removal is possible up to 80% of the
time. Generally, erythema overlying the subcutaneous tract of a tunneled catheter
necessitates catheter removal. Leaving the catheter in place may result in severe
cellulitis and soft tissue necrosis. If there is only erythema at the exit site, it may be
possible to salvage the line using antibiotics, usually vancomycin, through the CVC.
Considerations for removal would be those infections caused by fungi or non-
tuberculous mycobacteria or if there is persistent bacteremia after 48 to 72 hours of
appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Keeping the catheter in place is also usually
not advisable in critically ill or hemodynamically unstable patients. Bacteremia as a
consequence of S. aureus, gram-negative organisms, and fungemia caused by Candida
spp responds poorly to antimicrobial therapy alone. Therefore, prompt removal of
the catheter is recommended.

Prevention. Because of the serious complications associated with neutropenia,
preventive measures are critical in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy.
Patients should be immunized against pneumococcus and influenza. Administration
of live virus vaccines, such as measles-mumps-rubella or varicella zoster, is gener-
ally contraindicated. G-CSF, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce neu-
trophils, is frequently used prophylactically in patients receiving chemotherapy to
shorten the duration and depth of neutropenia, thereby reducing the risk of infec-
tion. It is sometimes used after a neutropenic patient develops a fever, but its use at
this point is controversial and may result in more harm than benefit.
Prophylactic use of oral quinolones to prevent gram-negative infection or the
use of antifungal agents to prevent Candida infection may reduce certain types of
infection, but it may also lead to the emergence of resistant organisms. Thus, this is
recommended for patients who are anticipated to have an ANC < 100 cells/mm3
for more than 7 days; antiviral agents are also recommended to reduce the risk of
herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster reactivation in this setting. Other recom-
mendations include avoiding sick contacts and overcrowded areas, as well as proper
handwashing and cough etiquette. Slight trauma to mucosal surfaces can cause bac-
teremia, so careful oral hygiene, avoidance of rectal thermometers or rectal exami-
nations, and skin care are also important.

comycin. He continues to have fever to 103 °F without an obvious source.
Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Add an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
B. Add an antifungal agent.
C. Continue present therapy.

of 350 cells/mm3, which has now resolved. Which of the following is the
most appropriate therapy?
A. Immunization against mumps
B. Immunization against varicella
C. Use of G-CSF after the next cycle of chemotherapy
D. Use of recombinant erythropoietin before the next cycle of chemotherapy
ANSWERS
42.1 B. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis,
along with S. aureus are the most common etiology of catheter-related infec-
tions because they are part of the skin flora. The other bacteria are isolated
at a much lower frequency, such as Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas species
(answers C and D), and even less common is C. albicans (answer A).
42.2 B. Antifungal therapy should be added when the fever is persistent for 5 to
7 days despite broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Patients with neutrope-
nia, defined as an ANC less than 1000 cells/µL, are at greater risk for bacte-
rial (gram-positive and gram-negative) and fungal infections such as caused
by C. albicans and Aspergillus. Answer A (aminoglycoside) would not add
much coverage to imipenem, which already has excellent gram-negative cov-
erage. Answer C (continue present therapy) is not wise with the persistent
fever. Answer D (lumbar puncture) is not indicated since there is no sign of
meningeal irritation. Answer E (stop all antibiotics) is not prudent in this
immunosuppressed patient.
42.3 C. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administered after chemotherapy
may decrease the duration and severity of neutropenia and the subsequent
risk of sepsis in these patients. Live vaccines, such as varicella (answer B) and
mumps (answer A), are contraindicated in immunosuppressed individuals.
Erythropoietin (answer D) is not indicated since the patient is not anemic.

A 20-year-old college student is the next patient in the emergency department.
When you walk into the room, he is lying on the examination table on his
side with his arm covering his eyes. The light in the room is turned off. His
temperature is 102.3 °F, heart rate is 110 beats per minute (bpm), and blood
pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. When you gently ask how he has been feeling, he
says that for the past 3 days he has had fever, body aches, and a progressively
worsening headache. The light hurts his eyes, and he is nauseated. He has not
had any episodes of emesis. He has experienced rhinorrhea but denies diarrhea,
cough, or nasal congestion. He has no known ill contacts. On examination, he has
no skin rash, and his pupils are difficult to assess due to photophobia. Ears and
oropharynx are normal. Heart, lung, and abdominal examinations are normal.
Neurologic examination reveals no focal neurologic deficits. Passive flexion of
his neck worsens his headache, and he is unable to touch his chin to his chest
without pain.

ANSWERS TO CASE 43:
Meningitis, Bacterial
Summary: A 20-year-old college student presents with
A 3-day history of fever, body aches, and headache

Fever to 102.3 °F

Photophobia and nausea

Nuchal rigidity suggesting meningeal irritation

Most concerning condition: Meningitis (especially bacterial).
Diagnostic test to confirm diagnosis: Lumbar puncture (LP) for evaluation of the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in some cases (not this one) preceded by a computed
tomographic (CT) scan of the head.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the clinical presentations of viral and bacterial meningitis. (EPA 1)
2. Discuss LP as the diagnostic test of choice for meningitis. (EPA 3)
3. Describe the CSF findings in different forms of meningitis. (EPA 3)
4. Recall the treatment for meningitis. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This 20-year-old college student has headache, nausea, photophobia, fever, and
neck pain and stiffness, all suggestive of meningitis, which could be caused by dif-
ferent organisms. Prompt LP and analysis of CSF are essential to establish the
diagnosis. Prior to the LP, a CT scan should be obtained if the patient is immuno-
compromised or has new-onset seizures, papilledema, altered mental status, or a
focal neurologic deficit. In the event that an LP cannot be performed prior to anti-
biotic administration, blood cultures can be obtained; they are positive in 50% to
90% of patients with meningococcal meningitis. Two sets of blood cultures should
be collected before the start of antibiotic therapy. In a patient without these signs
and symptoms, a preceding CT scan may be unnecessary. A purpuric skin rash
increases suspicion for Neisseria meningitidis. Antibiotic administration should not
be delayed in suspected meningococcal infection because progression of the disease
is rapid, and the mortality and morbidity are extremely high even when antibiotics
are given in a timely manner. This seemingly immunocompetent patient does not
have risk factors for fungal or parasitic organisms, and therefore empiric therapy
with intravenous antibiotics such as vancomycin with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone
should be initiated. However, patients at higher risk for opportunistic or unusual
organisms should be managed differently; these patients include those with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and low CD4 counts, immunosuppression from

chemotherapy or transplant antirejection agents, chronic antibiotic therapy, and
status post brain/spinal surgery.
APPROACH TO:
Meningitis
DEFINITIONS
ENCEPHALITIS: Brain parenchymal injury and inflammation most often sec-
ondary to a viral etiology. When focal brain parenchymal infection is secondary
to bacterial infection, it is usually termed cerebritis or abscess.
INFECTIOUS MENINGITIS: Inflammation of the subarachnoid space and
meninges caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa; infection is the most com-
mon etiology of meningitis.
PAPILLEDEMA: Swelling of the optic nerve caused by increased intracranial
pressure. On fundoscopic examination, the optic disc margin may appear hazy.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Infections of the central nervous system involve either the meninges (meningitis)
or the brain parenchyma (encephalitis). The incidence is dropping due to the more
widespread administration of pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines.
However, bacterial meningitis is still dangerous, with a case fatality rate of approxi-
mately 10% to 20% with treatment, and nearly 100% without any treatment. Seri-
ous sequelae, such as seizures, hearing loss, or brain damage, may occur despite
adequate treatment. College students are at risk due to living in close quarters with
other students.
Bacterial meningitis is the most common pus-forming intracranial infection,
with an incidence of 1.38 per 100,000 persons. The microbiology of the disease
has changed somewhat since the introduction of the H. influenzae type b vaccine in
the 1980s. Now Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial isolate, with
N. meningitidis as a close second. Group B Streptococcus or Streptococcus agalactiae
occurs in approximately 10% of cases, more frequently in neonates, patients older
than 50 years, and those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or liver disease.
Listeria monocytogenes accounts for approximately 10% of cases and must be con-
sidered in pregnant women, the elderly, and patients with impaired cell-mediated
immunity such as with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). H. influen-
zae is responsible for less than 10% of meningitis cases. Resistance to penicillin and
some cephalosporins is currently a concern in the treatment of S. pneumoniae.
Pathophysiology
Bacteria usually seed the meninges hematogenously after colonizing and invad-
ing the nasal or oropharyngeal mucosa. Occasionally, bacteria directly invade the
44_Toy-IM_Case43_p443-454.indd 445 03/09/20 9:05 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,473,"446 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
intracranial space from a site of abscess formation in the middle ear or sinuses. The
gravity and rapidity of progression of disease depend on characteristics of both the
host defense system and organism virulence. For example, patients with defects in
the complement cascade are more susceptible to invasive meningococcal disease.
Patients with CSF rhinorrhea caused by trauma or postsurgical changes may also
be more susceptible to bacterial invasion.
Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are common causes of men-
ingitis in patients following neurologic procedures such as placement of ventriculo-
peritoneal shunts. The brisk host inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space
may cause edema, vasculitis, and coagulation of vessels, leading to severe neurologic
complications, including seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and stroke. Acute
bacterial meningitis can progress over a matter of hours to days. Typical symptoms
include fever, nuchal rigidity, and headache. Patients may also complain of photo-
phobia, nausea and vomiting, as well as other nonspecific constitutional symptoms.
Approximately 75% of patients will experience some confusion or altered level of
consciousness. Less than 40% may experience seizures during the course of their
illness.
Differential Diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is fairly
limited and can be narrowed down depending on the patient’s age, exposure his-
tory, and course of illness. Various viral infections may also cause meningitis. The
most common include enteroviruses, which tend to be more common in the sum-
mer and fall. Patients may present with severe headache accompanied by symp-
toms of gastroenteritis. The CSF white blood cell (WBC) count will be elevated
with a predominance of lymphocytes, and glucose and protein levels are usually nor-
mal. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 or HSV-2 may cause a viral meningitis. The
CSF of these patients will also have a normal glucose level, whereas protein and
WBC counts will be elevated with a predominance of lymphocytes. Typically, these
patients have a high CSF red blood cell (RBC) count, which is not seen in bacterial
meningitis in the absence of a traumatic LP. In a patient with HIV infection, fungal
meningitis, specifically Cryptococcus, should be considered. Tuberculous meningitis
presents subacutely; it is more common in older, debilitated patients and patients
with HIV. Rickettsial disease, specifically Rocky Mountain spotted fever, may also
present with meningitis. Intracranial empyema, or brain or epidural abscess, should
be considered if the patient has focal neurologic findings. The one nonsuppurative
diagnosis in the differential is subarachnoid hemorrhage from bleeding intracranial
aneurysms. These patients present with sudden onset of the “worst headache of
their lives” in the absence of other symptoms of infection. They may have photo-
phobia, and the CSF will be grossly bloody; the supernatant will be xanthochromic,
reflecting the breakdown of blood into bilirubin.
Clinical Presentation
Some physical examination findings may be useful in the evaluation of a patient
with suspected meningitis. Nuchal rigidity is demonstrated when passive or active
flexion of the neck results in an inability to touch the chin to the chest. Classic tests
include Kernig and Brudzinski signs. Kernig sign can be elicited with the patient on
his or her back with the hip and knees flexed. The knee is then passively extended.

If passive extension of the knee elicits pain, the test is positive. Brudzinski sign is
positive if the supine patient flexes the knees and hips when the neck is passively
flexed. Neither sign is very sensitive for the presence of meningeal irritation. How-
ever, if present, both are highly specific. Papilledema, if present, would indicate
increased intracranial pressure. Focal neurologic signs, altered level of consciousness,
or seizures may reflect ischemia of the cerebral vasculature or focal suppuration.
Laboratory Evaluation. Blood cultures should be obtained in all patients
with suspected meningitis. LP and CSF evaluation are critical to the diagnosis.
Table 43–1 lists typical findings in the CSF from various etiologies of meningitis.
The necessity of imaging of the head and brain prior to performing an LP should
be individualized. CT scans are most useful in the initial presentation to exclude
intracranial mass or bleeding or to evaluate for other signs of increased intracranial
pressure. Performing an LP without a preceding imaging study in a patient with
signs of increased intracranial pressure poses the risk for brain herniation following
the LP procedure. However, studies have shown that in the patient with suspected
meningitis who does not have papilledema, focal neurologic signs, or altered level
of consciousness, an LP may be safely performed without preceding imaging. Fur-
thermore, in instances in which performance of the LP may be delayed, antibiotics
should be administered after blood cultures are obtained while awaiting the radio-
logic studies.
Ideally, the CSF should be examined within 30 minutes of antibiotics, but it
has been shown that it takes up to 4 to 10 hours for the CSF to become sterile in
a patient with pneumococcal meningitis. One exception is meningococcal menin-
gitis, in which cultures convert to negative within 1 hour of antibiotic administra-
tion. If CSF is obtained, then a culture and Gram stain should be studied. CSF cell
44_Toy-IM_Case43_p443-454.indd 447 03/09/20 9:05 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,475,"448 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
count, glucose, and protein levels should be measured. Though not very sensitive,
latex agglutination tests for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are highly specific
and can be useful in diagnosing the infectious agent in patients pretreated with
antibiotics. If positive, they can establish the etiology. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) testing is available for some bacteria; however, it may be more useful in the
diagnosis of herpes simplex and tuberculous meningitis. In all, no more than 3.5 to
4 mL of CSF is necessary. The most critical issue in a patient with suspected bacterial
meningitis is the initiation of antibiotics. The CSF examination and imaging studies
can be deferred in this medical emergency.
Imaging. When HSV meningoencephalitis is suspected, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) may demonstrate enhancement of the temporal lobes. In tubercu-
lous meningitis, enhancement of the basal region may be seen. An electroencepha-
logram (EEG) may be helpful in patients suspected of HSV meningitis. Within
2 to 15 days after the start of the illness, periodic sharp and slow wave complexes
originating within the temporal lobes can be demonstrated at 2- to 3-second
intervals. On the other hand, if purpuric skin lesions are present, a skin biopsy
may demonstrate N. meningitidis and can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.
The patient’s age may also provide clues regarding the etiology of the meningitis
(Table 43–2).
Treatment
Treatment of meningitis often is empiric until specific culture data are avail-
able. Because of the growing incidence of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci and
meningococci, the recommended empiric therapy in most regions is a high-dose

third-generation cephalosporin given concurrently with vancomycin. In some cases,
if the disease presentation is typical for meningococcus (with the characteristic
rash), third-generation cephalosporins are sufficient. If the organism is proven to
be susceptible to penicillin, therapy with high-dose penicillin G may be started.
Ampicillin is added when there is a concern for listeriosis. Acyclovir should be started
for suspicion of HSV, and antituberculosis therapy should be considered if the pre-
sentation is suspicious for tuberculous meningitis.
Glucocorticoids, when indicated, should be administered just before or concur-
rent with the first dose of antibiotics to reduce central nervous system inflamma-
tion and further neurologic deficits. One study in adults demonstrated decreased
mortality in patients with S. pneumoniae meningitis who were also given gluco-
corticoids. There are stronger data supporting steroids for H. influenzae and
S. pneumoniae meningitis in children. There is also some evidence for the benefit
of steroids in severe tuberculous meningitis. A Cochrane database review in 2015
concluded that corticosteroids may help reduce the incidence of hearing loss and
neurologic sequelae, but do not affect mortality.
Prevention. Prevention of meningitis can be achieved through the administra-
tion of vaccines and chemoprophylaxis to close contacts of the infected. Specific
vaccinations are available for H. influenzae type b and some strains of S. pneumoniae
and are now routinely administered to children. Meningococcal vaccination is rec-
ommended for those living in dormitories or close living quarters, such as college
students and military recruits, but not for the general population. Rifampin given
twice daily for 2 days or a single dose of ciprofloxacin is recommended for household
and close contacts of an index case of meningococcemia or meningococcal
meningitis.

43.2 A 55-year-old man with a long history of alcohol abuse has been hospital-
ized for 2 days. He was initially brought in by emergency medical services
to the emergency center with a 3-week history of progressive confusion and
stupor. On examination, he was afebrile, with heart rate 100 bpm and blood
pressure 130/70 mm Hg. He was confused and drowsy but would open
his eyes to verbal stimuli. On examination, he had a new right sixth cranial
nerve palsy and tremulousness of all four extremities. An LP was performed,
and his CSF showed 250 WBCs/mm3 (68% lymphocytes), 300 RBCs/mm3,
protein level of 1070 mg/dL, and glucose 10 mg/dL. The serum glucose
was 90 mg/dL. He was started on intravenous ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and
acyclovir as empiric therapy. A purified protein derivative (PPD) placed on
admission is positive today (48 hours), and bacterial cultures are negative at
48 hours. Which of the following would best help to confirm this patient’s
probable diagnosis?
A. CT of the head with contrast
B. Gram stain of throat scrapings
C. Herpes simplex virus PCR
D. MRI of the head
E. Repeat LP after 48 hours of therapy

the emergency center with a fever and severe headache of 3 days’ duration.
His temperature is 101 °F. There is no papilledema or focal neurologic find-
ings present. An LP is performed, and the Gram stain reveals gram-positive
rods. Which of the following therapies is most appropriate for this patient?
A. Ampicillin
B. Ceftriaxone
C. Gentamicin
D. Metronidazole
E. Vancomycin
ANSWERS
43.1 C. This young man most likely has viral meningitis, given the modest CSF
pleocytosis count with predominant lymphocytes. Given the high RBC count,
the etiology might be HSV, so acyclovir should be instituted until more spe-
cific testing can be performed. However, because bacterial meningitis cannot
be excluded based on the CSF analysis alone, empiric antibiotics should be
given until culture results are known; culture results usually return within
48 hours. Moreover, the early CSF findings in bacterial meningitis may resem-
ble those of viral meningitis. If in doubt, a second LP 24 to 48 hours later may
be advisable. This patient does not exhibit signs of immunosuppression, so
44_Toy-IM_Case43_p443-454.indd 450 03/09/20 9:05 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,478,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 451
fluconazole (answer D) is not necessary to treat fungal meningitis. Careful
observation without antibiotics (answer A) is inappropriate since untreated
bacterial meningitis is associated with severe morbidity or mortality. Intra-
venous azithromycin (answer B) is a standard treatment for community-
acquired pneumonia but has a very limited role in meningitis.
43.2 E. Tuberculous meningitis is extremely difficult to diagnose, and the index of
suspicion should be high in susceptible individuals. Certain clinical findings,
such as nerve palsies and CSF findings, including an extremely low glucose
and high protein levels with a fairly low WBC count, are highly suggestive
but not diagnostic. This patient has an elevated CSF protein level and low
CSF glucose level. Mortality is high and correlates with the delay in institut-
ing therapy. The only definitive test is acid-fast bacillus culture, but it can
take 6 to 8 weeks to grow. PCR test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is diag-
nostic if positive; however, the sensitivity is low, so a negative test does not
rule out the disease. Findings such as a positive PPD or CSF cell counts and
protein levels that do not change with standard antimicrobial or antiviral
therapies can also suggest the diagnosis. Low CSF glucose is a hallmark of
tuberculosis (TB) meningitis; if the glucose level falls at 48 hours, it is highly
suggestive of TB. A CT scan (answer A) and MRI (answer D) may demon-
strate basilar meningitis in TB, but this finding is not specific. TB meningitis
is an extrapulmonary form of TB; as such, pulmonary involvement occurs
concomitantly in 50% of patients. A chest x-ray can provide further data.
Gram stain of the throat (answer B) would not have a role in this case. HSV
PCR (answer C) should be performed on this patient since HSV can pres-
ent atypically; however, the typical HSV meningoencephalitis usually yields
CSF of mildly increased white cells (eg, 100 cells/mm3), glucose levels that
are normal or mildly decreased (40 mg/dL), and protein levels in the range of
100 to 600 mg/dL.
43.3 A. This patient should be placed on ampicillin as a minimum, and depending
on his absolute neutrophil count, a broader antimicrobial regimen may be
prudent. The organism identified by Gram stain is likely L. monocytogenes,
a gram-positive rod that causes approximately 10% of all cases of meningi-
tis. This infection is more common in the elderly and in other patients with
impaired cell-mediated immunity, such as patients on chemotherapy. It is also
more common in neonates. It is not sensitive to cephalosporins or aminogy-
lcosides, and specific therapy with ampicillin must be instituted if the sus-
picion for this disease is high. Ceftriaxone (answer B) is a third-generation
cephalosporin and is often chosen as a first-line agent for most community-
acquired meningitis pending cultures; however, because this patient has likely
Listeria meningitis, this agent would not be sufficient. Gentamicin (answer C)
is an adjuvant antibiotic and offers some synergistic effect when used with
another medication, such as a cephalosporin; gentamicin has no efficacy
against Listeria. Vancomycin (answer E) is used as part of the empiric antibi-
otics covering staphylococcal infections. Metronidazole (answer D) covers for
anaerobes and has little use in the therapy of meningitis.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Generally, an LP should not be delayed in a patient who is suspected
»
of having meningitis. If LP is contraindicated or impossible because of
hemodynamic instability, empiric therapy should be started immediately
after blood cultures are drawn.
CT imaging of the brain prior to LP is not necessary in most cases, but it
»
should be considered when the risk of brain herniation is high. These find-
ings include new-onset seizures, signs suspicious for space-occupying
lesions (eg, papilledema and focal neurologic signs), and moderate-
to-severe impairment in consciousness.
The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults is S. pneumoniae,
»
followed by N. meningitidis. L. monocytogenes meningitis may occur in
neonates and immunocompromised and older patients.
Patients who have undergone neurosurgical procedures or who have
»
been subject to skull trauma are at risk for staphylococcal meningitis.
Hemorrhagic CSF with evidence of temporal lobe involvement by imag-
»
ing or EEG suggests HSV meningoencephalitis; acyclovir is the treatment
of choice.
Corticosteroid use does not affect mortality but seems to reduce hearing
»
loss and neurologic sequelae. It should be used just before or concurrent
with antibiotic therapy.

A 62-year-old man is brought to the clinic for a 3-month history of unintentional
weight loss (12 lb). His appetite has diminished, but he reports no vomiting or
diarrhea. He does report some depressive symptoms since the death of his wife a
year ago, at which time he moved from Cambodia to the United States to live with
his daughter. He denies a smoking history. He complains of a 3-month history
of productive cough with greenish sputum. He has not felt feverish. He takes no
medications regularly. On examination, his temperature is 100.4 °F and respiratory
rate is 16 breaths per minute. His neck examination shows a normal thyroid gland
and no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. His chest has scattered
crackles in the left midlung fields and a faint expiratory wheeze on the right. His
heart rhythm is regular with no gallops or murmurs. His abdominal examination
is benign, his rectal examination shows no masses, and his stool is negative for
occult blood. His chest x-ray is shown in Figure 44–1.

Summary: A 62-year-old man from Cambodia presents with
A 12-lb unintentional weight loss over 3 months

Diminished appetite

A low-grade fever and productive cough

A chest x-ray with right upper lobe reticulonodular pattern and a left lung cavitary

Most likely diagnosis: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).
Next step: Serial sputum samples for identification of the organism and for culture
and sensitivities to guide antimicrobial therapy.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the natural history, clinical manifestations, and radiographic find-
ings of primary, secondary, and latent TB infection. (EPA 1, 3)
2. Understand the methods of diagnosis of TB. (EPA 1, 3)
3. Describe treatment strategies for TB. (EPA 4)
4. List the common extrapulmonary sites of TB infection, including the pleura,
lymph nodes, meninges, genitourinary tract, skeletal system, adrenal glands,
and miliary TB. (EPA 12)
Considerations
This elderly Asian man has symptoms suggestive of TB, including low-grade fever,
weight loss, and productive cough. A chest radiograph is essential to establish the
diagnosis. His chest x-ray shows findings consistent with TB, but many other dis-
eases may cause cavitary lung lesions, including other infections and malignancies. If
the sputum samples do not reveal acid-fast organisms, then further testing, such as
bronchoscopy, may be needed.

APPROACH TO:
Tuberculosis
DEFINITIONS
LATENT TB: Asymptomatic infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PRIMARY TB: Development of clinical illness immediately after infection with
M. tuberculosis.
REACTIVATION TB: Clinical illness that occurs when latent TB becomes active
and infectious after a period of dormancy. The dormant period can last years after
the initial infection.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Pulmonary TB. TB is a bacterial infection caused by the acid-fast bacillus (AFB) M.
tuberculosis, which is usually transmitted through airborne spread of droplets from
infected patients with pulmonary TB. Most cases occur in developing countries,
but a resurgence of cases in the United States occurred during the mid-1980s as a
consequence of various factors, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. Untreated disease can have a 1-year mortality rate of 33% and a 5-year
mortality rate as high as 50%.
Often seen in children, primary pulmonary TB usually affects the middle and
lower lobes. Lesions form in the periphery with hilar and paratracheal lymph-
adenopathy. Granulomatous lesions are caused by the inflammatory response of
lymphocytes and macrophages with cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF alpha). The center of the lesion may become necrotic (caseous necrosis) and
liquefied, forming a cavity. Healed lesions are called Ghon lesions. Most patients
exposed to M. tuberculosis do not manifest clinical symptoms, but they may have
a latent infection. Years later, TB may reactivate and become symptomatic. Reac-
tivation TB usually involves the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes
or the superior segments of the lower lobes of the lungs. The course may be rapid
(weeks to months), chronic and slowly progressive (“consumption”), or spontane-
ously remit.
Signs and symptoms are nonspecific and subacute, including fever, night sweats,
malaise, weight loss, and anorexia. The cough usually is productive of purulent
sputum and sometimes is streaked with blood. A Rasmussen aneurysm sometimes
develops in proximity to a cavitary lesion as the inflammatory reaction causes thin-
ning of the wall of an adjacent bronchial artery. Rupture of the aneurysm can lead
to massive hemoptysis. Physical findings are nonspecific and can include fever,
wasting, crackles and rhonchi, pallor, or finger clubbing. Possible laboratory abnor-
malities are leukocytosis, anemia, and hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.
Extrapulmonary TB. The sites of extrapulmonary spread of TB, in order of
decreasing frequency of occurrence, are the lymph nodes, pleura, genitourinary
45_Toy-IM_Case44_p455-464.indd 458 03/09/20 9:04 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,486,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 459
tract, bones and joints, meninges, and peritoneum. TB lymphadenitis is common
in HIV-infected patients, children, and nonwhite women, and it generally manifests
as painless adenopathy. Pleural disease can have an exudative effusion but may
require pleural biopsy for diagnosis. TB meningitis is usually diagnosed by finding
cerebrospinal fluid with high protein, lymphocyte predominance (or neutrophils
in early infection), and low glucose level. Adjunctive glucocorticoids may improve
the treatment response in TB meningitis. Genitourinary TB can be asymptomatic
or have local symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, and urinary frequency. It
is characterized by the finding of leukocytes in the urine but negative bacterial
cultures—termed “sterile pyuria.” Skeletal TB affects weight-bearing joints,
whereas Pott disease involves the spine. Miliary TB refers to hematogenously dis-
seminated TB and describes the radiographic or pathologic finding of 1- to 2-mm
granulomas that resemble millet seeds (hence the name). Adrenal involvement is
common in miliary TB and may cause adrenal insufficiency.
Diagnosis. The diagnosis of TB is made by combining the history and clini-
cal picture with AFB stains or culture of a specimen (smear or tissue biopsy).
When pulmonary TB is suspected, three sputum samples should be obtained
while the patient is on isolation if hospitalized. At least one of these should be
collected in the early morning. Biopsy material should not be put in formalde-
hyde. Culture results may take from 4 to 8 weeks on ordinary solid media or 2
to 3 weeks on liquid media.
Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) should also be performed on patients
with signs of active pulmonary TB disease. This is done through a sputum sample
as well, typically on the first respiratory specimen sent for AFB stains. Although
NAAT can help confirm the diagnosis of TB and may prompt earlier initiation of
treatment, it should not be used as a substitution for AFB testing. Confirmed TB
cases should be reported to the local public health department.
Purified protein derivative (PPD), or tuberculin, skin testing is useful for screen-
ing for latent TB infection but has a limited role in diagnosing active infection
because of frequent false-negative results in this setting. A positive PPD is defined
by induration of at least 5 mm after 48 to 72 hours, although this can vary based on
the risk group (Table 44–1).
Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are new diagnostic tools for latent TB.
They are in vitro blood tests of cell-mediated immune response to M. tuberculosis
and measure T-cell release of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) following stimula-
tion by TB antigens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rec-
ommends that such tests can be used in place of tuberculin skin testing. IGRAs are
preferred for patients with a history of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination
(it is not affected by BCG). It requires only one visit (PPD requires a second visit
to read the result 2 days after its intradermal administration). The most commonly
used IGRAs are the QuantiFERON™-TB Gold assay and the T-SPOT™ TB assay.
Treatment
The probable resistance pattern of the TB organism, based on the country of ori-
gin, may help to guide treatment. For individuals from areas with low drug resis-
tance, therapy generally starts with a 2-month course of four-drug treatment with

isoniazid (INH), rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months
of INH and rifampin. Multiple drugs are used to avoid development of resistance.
Directly observed treatment (watching patients take the medication) should be
instituted in all patients in this phase to ensure compliance. Pyridoxine is frequently
added to the regimen to prevent peripheral neuropathy caused by INH.
Drug resistance or intolerable side effects may require alternate therapy. Patients
should be monitored for hepatitis, hyperuricemia, and cytopenias—especially
thrombocytopenia—as these can indicate drug toxicity. The World Health Organi-
zation defines treatment failure as a positive smear or culture after 5 months of
therapy. Latent TB infection is usually treated with INH for 9 months or rifampin for
4 months, with the goal of preventing reactivation TB later in life. Extrapulmonary
TB sometimes requires longer therapy, which varies depending on the affected organ.

ops persistent fever, weight loss, and night sweats, and TB is suspected.
Which of the following is the most likely location of the TB?
A. Middle and lower lung zones
B. Pleural space
C. Apical segment of the upper lung lobes
D. Cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes

44.2 A 24-year-old man is being seen in the office for his monthly follow-up for
treatment with INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for active pulmonary TB.
He has been taking his medications for 3 months. While his cough and fever
are now resolved, he states that he is having numbness and tingling of both
feet but no back pain. He denies taking other medications. Which of the fol-
lowing is the most appropriate next step?
A. Perform a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar spine.
B. Initiate pyridoxine.
C. Continue the TB agents and monitor for further neurologic problems.
D. Initiate a workup for TB adenopathy compression on the femoral nerve.
44.3 A 25-year-old woman is seen in the clinic because her father, who recently
emigrated from South America, was diagnosed with and has been treated
for TB. She denies a cough, and her chest radiograph is normal. A PPD test
shows 10 mm of induration. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive.
Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Isoniazid
B. Combination therapy, including INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide
C. Observation
D. Induce three sputum samples
44.4 A 56-year-old woman is being seen at a pulmonary clinic for a chronic cough
and weight loss. She is diagnosed with pulmonary TB. She denies having
medical problems. The planned therapy includes INH and rifampin. Which
of the following tests are the most important to follow for a patient receiving
these agents for her TB treatment?
A. Renal function tests
B. Liver function tests
C. Slit-lamp examinations
D. Amylase and lipase tests
ANSWERS
44.1 C. Reactivation TB (in this case, likely triggered by infliximab) usually involves
the apical aspects of the lungs. Primary pulmonary TB infection most often
affects the middle and lower lobes (answer A). Lymphadenitis (answer D)
and pleural disease (answer B) are the most common extrapulmonary TB
infections, but they are less common than pulmonary TB.
44.2 B. Pyridoxine (vitamin B ) is important for preventing the peripheral neurop-
6
athy that can complicate INH therapy. Assuming that his neurologic exami-
nation is normal other than some minimal decreased sensation, initiation of
pyridoxine and careful monitoring is the best course of action. If the physical
examination shows weakness, abnormal deep tendon reflexes, or dermatomal
distribution, then imaging of the lumbar spine such as CT scan (answer A)
45_Toy-IM_Case44_p455-464.indd 461 03/09/20 9:04 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,489,"462 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
would be indicated. If the numbness were caused by Pott disease, he would
be expected to have back pain and other neurologic findings, such as lower
extremity weakness. Continuing therapy without pyridoxime is inappropri-
ate (answer C), and vitamin B should have been started at the onset of his
6
therapy. Workup for femoral nerve impingement (answer D) is not indicated
unless the physical examination points to a pure femoral nerve palsy.
44.3 A. Because this woman is a household contact of a patient with active TB,
she is in the highest risk group. Her skin test would be considered positive
with 5-mm induration. Therefore, observation (answer C) would be inap-
propriate, and inducing three sputum samples (answer D) would not be
required. She has latent TB infection and should be offered treatment to pre-
vent reactivation TB later in life. INH is the treatment of choice for exposure
prophylaxis. Rifampin offers a safe alternative for a shorter duration. Triple
therapy (answer B) is indicated for an active TB infection, but not for a con-
tact asymptomatic situation.
44.4 B. Drug-induced liver injury is a complication of treatment with INH, pyra-
zinamide, and rifampin; therefore, liver enzyme levels are the most impor-
tant parameters to monitor. Baseline liver tests are obtained in all patients,
and monthly monitoring of hepatic enzymes is recommended for patients at
increased risk of liver toxicity. Alcohol use, prior liver disease, pregnancy, and
the first 3 months postpartum are risk factors for liver injury. Renal (answer A)
and pancreatic (answer D) functions are not as much of a concern with drugs
used to treat TB. Slit-lamp examinations assess the anterior chamber of the
eye (answer C) and are indicated for medications such as amiodarone, which
can cause corneal deposits; the TB drug that can lead to blindness is eth-
ambutol, but this would be an optic neuritis and not detected on slit-lamp
examination.

A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic. In the chart, the chief complaint is listed
as, “Wants a general checkup.” You enter the room and greet a generally healthy-
appearing young man who seems nervous. He finally admits that he has been
worried about a lesion on his penis. He denies pain or dysuria. He has never had
any sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and has an otherwise unremarkable
medical history. He is afebrile, and his examination is notable for a shallow, clean
ulcer without exudates or erythema on the shaft of his penis, which is nontender
to palpation and has a cartilaginous consistency. There are some small, nontender,
inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally.

Syphilis
Summary: A 23-year-old healthy man presents with
A firm nontender penile ulcer

Nontender inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally

Most likely diagnosis: Chancre of primary syphilis.
Likely treatment: Single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathogenesis and natural history of Treponema pallidum infec-
tion. (EPA 1, 12)
2. Name the differential diagnosis of genital ulceration and STIs. (EPA 2)
3. Explain how to diagnose syphilis. (EPA 3)
4. Describe the treatment of syphilis. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This 23-year-old man reluctantly reveals his concern about a nontender ulcer of
the penis. Although he has no history of STIs, the most common cause of a pain-
less ulcer of the genital area in a young, immunocompetent person is syphilis. The
STIs often present together, so he should be evaluated for other STIs, such as
Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other causes
of genital ulcers should also be considered, including chancroid and herpes virus
(both usually painful), and a superficially infected skin lesion. Compliance with
therapy and follow-up are crucial because syphilitic infections can become chronic
and lead to cardiovascular and neurologic disease. Additionally, he could transmit
the disease to others, including women of childbearing age, who, if infected during
pregnancy, could pass the infection to their newborns.

APPROACH TO:
Syphilis
DEFINITIONS
LATENT SYPHILIS: Asymptomatic period between secondary and tertiary
syphilis. It is classified as early (up to 1-year duration), late (after 1 year), or of
unknown duration.
PRIMARY SYPHILIS: Initial lesion of T. pallidum infection, usually in the form of
a firm, nontender ulcer (the chancre).
SECONDARY SYPHILIS: Disseminated infection manifesting in a pruritic, macu-
lopapular diffuse rash that classically involves the palms and soles, or the flat moist
lesion of condyloma lata.
TERTIARY (LATE) SYPHILIS: Symptomatic infection involving the central ner-
vous system (CNS), cardiovascular system, or the skin and subcutaneous tissues
(gummas).
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Syphilis is classically called one of the “great imitators” for its multifaceted manifes-
tations. After a decline in cases over the prior decades, the incidence of syphilis has
been skyrocketing since the 1980s. The public health consequences of late-stage
or undiagnosed syphilis can be devastating, so recognizing and correctly treating
this disease is of great importance. In 2017, new syphilis cases increased by 10.5%
from the previous year, resulting in 30,644 cases of reported primary and second-
ary disease in the United States. The largest growing demographics include men
who have sex with men (MSM) and women (possibly secondary to increased drug
use). Other patterns seen were high primary and secondary cases seen in associa-
tion with HIV coinfection MSM, men living in the western United States, black
males, and men aged 20 to 34. Late-stage syphilis also saw increased rates that were
associated with the use of screening and confirmatory testing.
Clinical Presentation
Caused by the spirochete T. pallidum, the organism penetrates abraded skin or
mucous membranes in order to disseminate through the lymphatics and blood-
stream to later involve almost every organ. The most common form of transmission
is via sexual exposure through open lesions that are extremely infectious (above
30% transmission rate); on the other hand, cutaneous inoculation has lower risk
of transmission. Within 1 week to 3 months of inoculation, a painless papule
develops that eventually ulcerates into a chancre, which usually forms at the site of
entrance. Multiple ulcers may form in addition with regional lymphadenopathy, but
some patients may not notice the ulceration at all. The chancre of syphilis is typically
nonerythematous, with rolled borders and a clean base, with a very firm consistency
on palpation. It usually is painless, although it may be mildly tender if touched.
46_Toy-IM_Case45_p465-474.indd 467 03/09/20 9:03 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,495,"468 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
The appearance of the chancre represents primary syphilis. Other diseases that pres-
ent with ulcerations include chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi and herpes
simplex infection. Chancroid ulcers are usually painful and exudative, with ragged
borders and a necrotic base that bleeds easily. Lymph nodes can also suppurate in
chancroid, unlike in syphilis. The ulcers in herpes simplex infections typically are
painful, grouped vesicles on an erythematous base that eventually ulcerate.
If untreated, the syphilitic chancre disappears within 2 to 6 weeks, and the
disease progresses to a second stage and disseminates widely; characteristically,
the patient may present with a pruritic, maculopapular diffuse rash that classically
involves the palms and soles. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, myalgias, head-
ache, and weight loss can develop in untreated patients in addition to dermatologic
findings such as condyloma lata, a gray papillomatous lesion found in intertriginous
areas, and patchy hair loss. Secondary syphilis can also affect the following: the
liver, skeletal muscle, kidneys, and CNS.
If still left untreated, the patient will transition into a quiescent, or latent, stage.
Although relapses of symptoms of secondary syphilis can occur during this time,
they become less frequent over years. Between 25% and 40% of patients will go
on to develop late-stage syphilis, which can occur 1 to 30 years after initial infec-
tion. The symptoms of this stage result from infiltration and destruction of various
tissues as a result of chronic infection. The most frequent clinical presentations
involve the CNS (neurosyphilis), cardiovascular system, and diffuse organ involve-
ment. The immune reaction to T. pallidum causes a proliferative, obliterative end-
arteritis, which involves the vasa vasorum, leading to necrosis of the tunica media
and arterial wall. This progressive weakness of the walls leads to the formation of
saccular aneurysmal dilations of the aorta. In some organs, such as the skin, liver,
and bone, these lesions organize into granulomas with an amorphous or coagulated
center called gummas. While benign, gummas create organ dysfunction through
their progressive destruction of normal tissue. The phase known as latent syphi-
lis involves the period where the patient fails to show clinical manifestations but
has positive serologic testing. This distinction matters when treatment is being
considered.
Neurosyphilis is another form of tertiary disease that may occur after second-
ary disease or from the latent stage. T. pallidum disseminates within the cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF), before spreading to the vasculature and meninges in the early
phase and later the brain and spinal cord in advanced stages. In the CNS, it may
cause progressive vasculitis associated with local ischemia, stroke, and gradual focal
neurologic deficits. Some patients may exhibit personality changes or even demen-
tia. T. pallidum causes demyelination of the posterior spinal column, leading to a
wide-based gait, ataxia, and loss of proprioception (tabes dorsalis); other cranial
nerve impairments include the development of the Argyll Robertson, small bilat-
eral pupils that do not constrict when exposed to bright light but do constrict when
focused on a nearby object. Lumbar puncture should be performed to exclude
neurosyphilis in any patient with previous syphilis diagnosis who develops neuro-
logic or ocular symptoms; evaluation of the CSF should strongly be considered in
asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with syphilis with CD4 < 350 cells/mm3 or
with a high rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer (> 1:32) since these conditions greatly
increase the risk of CNS infection.

Laboratory Findings. The diagnosis of syphilis is always made indirectly, as the
organism has not yet been cultured. Diagnostic tests for T. pallidum are divided into
two categories: nontreponemal (nonspecific) and treponemal. Nonspecific sero-
logic tests, such as the RPR and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)
tests, examine the reactivity of serum antibodies against lipid antigens in response
to the host reaction to T. pallidum. Despite its sensitivity, the likelihood for false
positives is higher at low titers. Therefore, confirmatory testing in the form of spe-
cific antibody testing for T. pallidum, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorption (FTA-ABS) or microhemagglutination assay for T. pallidum (MHA-TP)
test, is the next step. Traditionally, treponemal tests were not utilized until initial
screening returned positive; however, technological advances have allowed for them
to now serve as initial screening tests for syphilis (known as reverse screening).
FTA-ABS and MHA-TP tests determine current serum antibodies against trepo-
nemal antigens. Dark-field microscopy, in which scrapings from an ulcer are placed
under a phase contrast lens to identify the organisms, remains the classic method
of diagnosis but is rarely performed today. Lesion biopsy, such as those performed
in secondary syphilis with special stains, also can identify the organisms. A posi-
tive CSF VDRL or RPR test in the setting of increased CSF leukocytosis, elevated
protein levels, and sometimes with low glucose levels, is suggestive of CNS involve-
ment. False-negative results for the VDRL test in CSF are common; however, clini-
cal suspicion remains crucial for an accurate diagnosis.
Treatment
The treatment of choice for syphilis is penicillin, specifically parenteral penicillin G,
in all stages. Treatment recommendations vary based on the stage of syphilis
(Table 45–1). Individuals with early disease, specifically primary, secondary, or

aFor penicillin-allergic patients with primary, secondary, and latent syphilis, oral tetracycline or doxycycline for 2 weeks is
an acceptable treatment. For penicillin-allergic patients with neurosyphilis or syphilis in pregnancy, desensitization and
treatment with penicillin are required.

early latent syphilis, may be treated with a single intramuscular injection of ben-
zathine penicillin, a long-lasting intramuscular injection. Alternative therapies
include doxycycline or, tetracycline, or for up to 14 days. Ceftriazone IM or IV
for 10-14 days has been used but the optimal dosage has not been established.
For patients with late latent disease or unknown duration of the latent phase
(presumed to be > 1 year), those with cardiovascular manifestations, or those with
gummas, treatment consists of three weekly intramuscular injections of benzathine
penicillin. Alternative therapies include doxycycline or tetracycline for various time
frames.
Neurosyphilis is notoriously difficult to treat. Those with known CNS disease
require high doses of intravenous penicillin G for 10 to 14 days; an alternative
but inferior therapy is daily IV ceftriaxone for 10 to 14 days. All patients should
be followed closely to ensure that their titers fall over the year after treatment.
Pregnant women who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and then
receive penicillin, as this is the only treatment known to prevent congenital infec-
tion. The sequelae of congenital syphilis can be devastating; this is why the World
Health Organization has developed initiatives to increase prenatal screening and
treatment of syphilis.
Prognosis. T. pallidum infection usually leads to a positive specific serologic test
(FTA-ABS or MHA-TP) for life, whereas an adequately treated infection will lead
to a fall in RPR serology. A normal response is considered a four-fold drop in titers
within 3 months and a negative or near-negative titer after 1 year. A suboptimal
response may mean inadequate treatment, undiagnosed tertiary disease, or reinfec-
tion. In some persons, nontreponemal antibodies can persist, usually in low titers,
for a long period of time, a response referred to as the “serofast reaction.” Most
patients who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remain-
der of their lives, regardless of treatment or disease activity.
Nontreponemal titers should be collected prior to treatment initiation, as
they can increase shortly after starting therapy. Shortly after starting treatment,
a patient can experience constitutional symptoms such as fevers, myalgia, rigors,
rash, headache, hypotension, and sometimes even seizures or alterations in mental
status. While not completely understood, it is believed that the lysis of infected
cells can cause a massive inflammatory response. This phenomenon is referred to as
a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction and should not result in stopping treatment.
Prevention. In any patient diagnosed with an STI, the possibility of coinfection
with other STIs should be considered. HIV is often asymptomatic early in the
course of infection, and screening should be recommended to those persons who
have histories of high-risk behaviors or who have evidence of other STIs. Because
HIV takes months to undergo seroconversion, the screening strategy should last
for that long.
Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial STI in the United States,
and the majority of newly diagnosed patients report being asymptomatic, espe-
cially women. In women, it characteristically causes cervicitis (vaginal discharge,
postcoital bleeding) and urethritis (dysuria or urinary tract infection symptoms).
46_Toy-IM_Case45_p465-474.indd 470 03/09/20 9:03 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,498,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 471
If untreated, C. trachomatis can ascend the female reproductive tract, leading to
severe abdominal and pelvic pain, adnexal tenderness, worsening cervicitis, vaginal
discharge, and dysuria, collectively known as pelvic inflammatory disease. Repeated
episodes can result in tubal scarring and increased risk of infertility. Men with
symptoms typically present with urethritis (dysuria and urethral discharge), but
they may also experience fever, epididymitis, or proctitis with rectal pain or diar-
rhea. Diagnosis is usually made by antigen detection or gene probe directly from
the urethra or cervix. Treatment consists of a single dose of 1000 mg of azithromy-
cin (often given under direct observation) or a 7-day course of doxycycline.
Neisseria gonorrheae, a gram-negative diplococcus, can present with similar clini-
cal syndromes as Chlamydia (in fact, up to 30% of patients are coinfected with both
organisms), but patients are more likely to be symptomatic, especially men. His-
torically, N. gonorrhoeae can initially present as disseminated infection characterized
by fever, migratory polyarthritis, tenosynovitis of hands and feet, a rash on the
distal extremities, and rare incidences of endocarditis or meningitis. Unlike pri-
mary N. gonorrhoeae management, disseminated infection requires hospitalization
and intravenous ceftriaxone. Outpatients with genitourinary symptoms are often
treated with a single intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone, along with a single dose
of azithromycin 1000 mg or doxycycline for a 7-day course for likely Chlamydia
coinfection.

45.2 As part of normal screening during pregnancy, a 28-year-old patient
(gravida 2, para 1) has a positive RPR test with a titer of 1:64 and a positive
MHA-TP and is treated with intramuscular penicillin. She returns to your
office 3 months later with an RPR titer of 1:8. Which of the following treat-
ments do you offer?
A. Repeat single injection of intramuscular penicillin
B. No treatment is necessary
C. Three injections of intramuscular penicillin weekly
D. Doxycycline
45.3 A 23-year-old man is found to have late latent syphilis (RPR 1:64) as part of
a workup following his diagnosis with HIV. He is asymptomatic, has a CD4
count of 150 cells/mm3, and does not remember having lesions or rashes in
the past. Prior to starting therapy with penicillin for the syphilis, the patient
should undergo which of the following procedures?
A. Lumbar puncture to exclude neurosyphilis
B. Skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain and an electroencepha-
logram (EEG)
D. Skin testing to exclude penicillin allergy
E. Adjustment of his HIV medications to optimize his CD4 count prior to
treatment for syphilis
45.4 A 28-year-old woman is seen in the office for “sores” on her vulva area. She
denies a recent change in sexual partners and is not aware of any STI. On
examination, she is found to have a nontender 1-cm ulcer of the right labia
majus. A herpes culture is taken of the ulcer scraping, which is negative.
A serum RPR titer is also negative. Which of the following is the next best step?
A. Empiric treatment with doxycycline for C. trachomatis
B. Empiric treatment with acyclovir for herpes simplex virus
C. Empiric treatment with azithromycin for Haemophilus ducreyi
D. Dark-field microscopy/empiric treatment with intramuscular penicillin
E. Biopsy for possible vulvar cancer
ANSWERS
45.1 C. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
guidelines, men with high-risk sexual behaviors should be screened at least
annually or more frequently for HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, and
treated if they have a positive result. There are no data to support empiri-
cally treating for all STIs (answer A). This patient has a history of not using
barrier contraception; thus, encouraging abstinence (answer D) and condom
use (answer B) are insufficient. There are data to support starting individu-
als with high-risk sexual practices on PrEP (tenofovir and emtricitabine)
46_Toy-IM_Case45_p465-474.indd 472 03/09/20 9:03 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,500,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 473
to avoid infection with HIV (answer E); however, this will not reduce the
patient’s transmission of other STIs at this time.
45.2 B. A four-fold change in titer, equivalent to a change of two dilutions (eg,
from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:8 to 1:32) is considered necessary to demonstrate
a clinically significant difference between two nontreponemal test results
obtained using the same serologic test. This patient’s titer has dropped more
than four-fold and thus can be considered successfully treated. Therefore,
repeat treatment with penicillin is not necessary (answers A and C). Fail-
ure of nontreponemal test titers to decline four-fold within 6 to 12 months
after therapy for primary or secondary syphilis might be indicative of treat-
ment failure (per the CDC guideline). Doxycycline (answer D) should only
be used in a patient who has a true allergy to penicillin and cannot undergo
desensitization.
45.3 A. Lumbar puncture to exclude neurosyphilis is generally indicated when any
patient with syphilis develops neurologic or ocular symptoms; it is also con-
sidered if HIV-infected patients with syphilis have a CD4 count less than
350 cells/mm3 or an RPR titer exceeding 1:32. Skin biopsy (answer B) is not
the way to diagnose syphilis; rather, diagnostic procedures include serology
or, if very early, scraping with dark-field analysis. MRI and EEG (answer C)
are not indicated in an asymptomatic patient and would not diagnose CNS
syphilis. Skin testing for penicillin allergy (answer D) is not indicated unless
the patient had a history of severe allergic reactions. Adjustment of HIV
medications prior to penicillin (answer E) is not indicated, and once the stage
of syphilis is ascertained, treatment should be started.
45.4 D. Approximately one-third of patients who have the primary lesion of the
chancre will have negative serology. They will require either dark-field micros-
copy or biopsy with special stains to identify the spirochetes; the organism
is too thin to be visualized by conventional light microscopy. Empiric treat-
ment with penicillin is reasonable if dark-field microscopy is not available.
Chancroid (answer C) is much less likely due to the epidemiologic consider-
ations, and usually this condition is painful. Genital herpes (answer B) and
chancroid should produce painful genital ulcers, and Chlamydia (answer A)
should cause nonulcerative cervicitis or urethritis. Biopsy for vulvar cancer
(answer E) is indicated for an older patient or a persistent ulcer, but it is not
indicated in this patient.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Syphilitic chancres are generally clean, painless, ulcerative lesions that
»
resolve in 2 to 6 weeks if untreated; the eruption of a maculopapular rash
on the palms and soles signifies secondary syphilis.
Elevated RPR and VDRL tests are nonspecific and may be falsely positive
»
in several normal conditions (pregnancy) and disease states (systemic
lupus erythematosus).

Case Files Internal Medicine,501,"474 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Specific treponemal antibody tests, such as the MHA-TP and the FTA-ABS
»
test, should be performed for confirmation of a syphilis diagnosis, but
once positive, they usually stay positive for life.
The reverse testing algorithm has advantages over traditional testing in
»
that T. pallidum antibodies (1) are specific to syphilis, (2) are more sensi-
tive than VDRL testing or RPR titer for detecting both primary and late
syphilis, (3) can be tested using automated instruments, and (4) can pro-
vide a more rapid time to result. The biggest clinical impact of the reverse
algorithm is the recognition of untreated late latent syphilis.
Current screening now is utilizes the specific treponemal antibody
»
tests first (reverse screening) due to their higher specificity for syphilis
infection.
A declining RPR titer can be followed to test the efficacy of therapy, and
»
if levels fail to decline or increase, it can point at incomplete treatment,
failed therapy, or possible reinfection.
Central nervous system involvement can be excluded only through test-
»
ing of the CSF.
Treatment of syphilis is based on stage: Early syphilis can be treated with
»
a single intramuscular injection of penicillin; late latent syphilis can be
treated with three weekly injections; and neurosyphilis or tertiary syphilis
can be treated with intravenous penicillin for 10 to 14 days.
If a patient presents with a positive titer and has reported past treatment,
»
it is important to confirm with the state health department to avoid
re-treating.

A 27-year-old man infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presents
to the emergency department (ED) with a fever of 39.2 °C (102.5 °F). His last CD4
count is unknown. The patient was diagnosed as HIV positive approximately
3 years ago when he presented to his primary care provider with oral thrush.
At that time, he was immediately started on highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART). Approximately 10 months ago, the patient discontinued all treatment
due to inability to pay for his medications after losing his job and health insurance.
He reports feeling more fatigued recently. For the last 3 to 4 weeks, the patient
endorses subjective fevers, a nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath with
mild exertion, such as when walking upstairs in his house. The patient noticed
unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 pounds over the last 2 months. The
patient’s blood pressure (BP) is 134/82 mm Hg, pulse is 110 beats per minute
(bpm), and respirations are 28 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 89% on
room air but drops to 80% with minimal exertion, and his breathing becomes
quite labored. Physical examination shows a cachectic male in mild respiratory
distress seated upright in bed. The patient is tachypneic with clear lung fields
and white, painless plaques covering his oral mucosa; these plaques are easily
scraped off with a tongue depressor. He denies dysphagia. The remaining
physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory testing shows a leukocyte
count of 2800 cells/mm3. Serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is 540 U/L (normal
140-280 IU/L). Chest radiograph is shown in Figure 46–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 46:
HIV/AIDS and Pneumocystis Pneumonia
Summary: A 27-year-old man presents with
A known HIV infection but unknown CD4 count

Ten months without antiretroviral therapy or prophylactic medications

3 to 4 weeks of fevers, dry cough, weight loss, and worsening dyspnea on exertion

Febrile temperature of 39 °C, tachycardia, tachypnea

Oxygen saturation 89% on room air and 80% with minimal exertion

Painless, white oral plaques that can be scraped

Chest x-ray showing bilateral, interstitial lung opacities

Leukocyte count < 3500 cells/mm3, LDH elevated

Most likely diagnosis: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP); the history, presumed
low CD4 count (based on the presence of oral thrush), chest film appearance, and
elevated serum LDH make this diagnosis highly suggestive.
Next diagnostic step: Obtain sputum samples for microbiological analysis (specify
what you are looking for). Consider a bronchoalveolar lavage if the sputum analysis
yields no diagnosis.
Preventive measures: Aside from HAART, prophylactic administration of
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) could have reduced his likelihood
of acquiring PJP once his CD4 count dropped below 200 cells/mm3. The most
recent guidelines no longer recommend TMP-SMX if the patient takes HAART
and has undetectable HIV viral load (not applicable to this patient), regardless of
the CD4 count.
Next step in management: The next step is to stabilize the patient. Although hemo-
dynamically stable, he remains tachypneic, hypoxic, and in mild distress. The
hypoxemia should be treated with supplemental oxygen or, if needed, endotracheal
intubation and mechanical ventilation. An arterial blood gas (ABG) measure-
ment should be obtained to quantify his degree of hypoxemia and initiate proper
treatment.

Considerations
This individual with HIV, currently not taking antiviral medications or any anti-
biotic prophylaxis, presents with subacute dyspnea and cough. His lack of sputum
production, hypoxia, and elevated LDH level are suggestive of PJP. The protracted
course makes Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma, or influenza infection less
likely. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can present with atypical radiologic features in
severely immunocompromised patients. Other mycobacteria, like Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare complex (MAC); certain fungi, such as Cryptococcus neofor-
mans, Coccidioides immitis, or Aspergillus species; and Nocardia species; and Kaposi
sarcoma are only a few examples of a broad differential diagnosis for the patient
with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. The presence of oral thrush strongly sug-
gests a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3; however, oral candidiasis can be pres-
ent regardless of CD4 count. If laboratory findings reveal a CD4 count lower than
200 cells/mm3, then PJP seems the most likely explanation for his symptoms and
chest x-ray findings. Obtaining an ABG measurement will provide additional infor-
mation about prognosis and guide therapy to determine the utility of corticoste-
roid administration. Arterial oxygen concentration less than 70 mm Hg on room
air or alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) greater than or equal to 35 mm Hg
suggests more severe disease. Treatment with corticosteroids may be helpful when
given concurrently with antibiotic therapy, such as TMP-SMX.
APPROACH TO:
HIV/AIDS and Pneumocystis Pneumonia
DEFINITIONS
ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS): An advanced
stage of HIV infection in which the CD4 count is lower than 200 cells/mm3 or in
which an AIDS-defining illness is diagnosed, regardless of the CD4 count.
PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI (FORMERLY PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII):
A unicellular fungus that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised patients,
especially those infected with AIDS.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
When evaluating a patient with HIV infection and suspected opportunistic infec-
tions, determining the level of immunodeficiency via the CD4 count is of clini-
cal significance. Normal CD4 levels in adults range from 600 to 1500 cells/mm3.
As levels decline to fewer than 500 cells/mm3, immune function decreases, and
patients become increasingly more susceptible to opportunistic infections and/or
malignancies.
As many as 40% of patients at the time of initial HIV infection will develop an
acute HIV syndrome characterized by sudden onset of a mononucleosis-like illness
47_Toy-IM_Case46_p475-486.indd 478 03/09/20 9:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,506,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 479
with fever, headaches, nontender lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, myalgias, diar-
rhea, weight loss, and sometimes a macular rash. The most common symptoms are
fever, myalgias, and generalized fatigue. The rest of the patients remain asymptom-
atic and have a clinically latent period of 8 to 10 years, on average, before the clinical
manifestations of immunocompromise appear. As CD4 levels decline, the risk of
contracting opportunistic infections or reactivation of dormant illnesses increases.
At CD4 levels less than 500 cells/mm3, patients are susceptible to infections,
such as recurrent pneumonias, tuberculosis (TB), vaginal candidiasis, and herpes
zoster.
At CD4 levels less than 200 cells/mm3, patients are diagnosed with AIDS and
are considered significantly immunocompromised. Patients with AIDS can easily
contract infections by organisms that rarely cause significant illness in immuno-
competent hosts, such as PJP, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and
cryptosporidiosis.
At CD4 levels less than 50 cells/mm3, patients are severely immunocompro-
mised and are susceptible to disseminated infection with MAC, cytomegalovirus
(CMV) retinitis, colitis, and esophagitis and malignancies such as primary central
nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion has published a list of AIDS-defining conditions, which are clinical conditions
that define progression from HIV to AIDS (Table 46–1).
Differential Diagnosis. Many other respiratory infections are possible and should
be considered in patients with AIDS. Chest radiography helps to narrow down
possible diagnoses. Diffuse interstitial lung opacities present in PJP, M. tuberculosis,
other mycobacterial infections (such as MAC). Patchy alveolar and nodular lung
opacities are also described in the former infections as well as in viral infections,
such as CMV. Pleural-based opacities are commonly described in TB and crypto-
coccal lung disease. Cavitary lesions are seen in TB, PJP, and coccidiomycosis.
In addition to imaging, remember the importance of obtaining a clinical and
travel history. Since the most common causes of bacterial pneumonia in AIDS
patients are the same organisms that cause pneumonia in immunocompetent hosts,
acute onset of fever, and productive cough, along with pulmonary opacities, should
suggest community-acquired pneumonia.
A more indolent or chronic history of cough (productive or nonproductive)
with weight loss and/or persistent night sweats, especially in high-risk patients
(ie, recent exposures, previous incarceration, homelessness or association with
shelters, recent emigrant from highly endemic countries, or health care workers),
should raise the question of TB. In patients with CD4 count more than 200 cells/
mm3, the radiographic appearance of TB is likely to be similar to that of immuno-
competent hosts. However, in those with CD4 count lower than 200 cells/mm3, the
radiographic appearance is extremely variable; this population often presents with
noncavitary pulmonary lesions, lymphadenopathy, and more diffuse presentation of
TB (miliary or cutaneous findings). Patients with suspected pulmonary TB should
be placed in respiratory isolation until their airborne infectiveness is ruled out.
A negative purified protein derivative (tuberculin skin test) or interferon-gamma
release assay does not rule out TB in immunocompromised hosts, as they might
not be able to mount an immunologic response. Diagnosis and treatment of TB

is discussed in Case 44, but it should be noted that TB in AIDS patients primar-
ily spreads hematogenously and produces extrapulmonary manifestations. In HIV
patients, Mycobacterium kansasii also causes pulmonary disease and radiographic
findings identical to those of M. tuberculosis.
Several other opportunistic infections in AIDS deserve mention. Cerebral toxo-
plasmosis is the most common central nervous system (CNS) space-occupying lesion in
AIDS patients presenting with headache, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits. Con-
trasted computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
reveal multiple ring-enhancing lesions, often located in the basal ganglia. Presump-
tive diagnosis often is made based on the radiologic appearance, supported by sero-
logic evidence of infection. Treatment consists of 2 weeks of empiric toxoplasmosis
therapy with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine; the most likely alternative diagnosis
is CNS lymphoma. CNS lymphoma usually presents with a single mass lesion but
is suspected when presumed lesions of toxoplasmosis do not regress after 2 weeks
of specific therapy. If this is the case, historically, the next diagnostic step has been
47_Toy-IM_Case46_p475-486.indd 480 03/09/20 9:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,508,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 481
stereotactic brain biopsy. However, recent evidence indicates a next step of examining
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for Epstein-Barr virus DNA to find malignant lymphocytes
that are more likely to be present in immunocompromised patients with CNS lym-
phoma. Treatment includes starting high-dose methotrexate because of its CNS pen-
etration, glucocorticoids to decrease mass effect, and restarting antiretroviral therapy.
Another CNS complication that requires a high index of suspicion is cryptococcal
meningitis. This is a chronic, indolent fungal infection due to C. neoformans, which
often presents with vague symptoms, including fever, headaches, fatigue, personality
and vision disturbances, and sometimes vomiting or nuchal rigidity; keep in mind
that some patients can present with sepsis and in a coma. If the diagnosis is consid-
ered, the patient should be screened for evidence of cryptococcal infection by testing
for cryptococcal antigen in the serum and via lumbar puncture (LP) for culture.
Imaging (CT or MRI) needs to be performed prior to LP to prevent possible
cerebral herniation. The CSF frequently shows mild inflammatory response (ie, low,
mostly lymphocytic, white blood cell count; increased CSF protein; and low glucose
levels), but the patient often presents with elevated intracranial pressures. Diagno-
sis can be confirmed by identifying the yeast using, fungal culture or measuring the
level of cryptococcal antigen from CSF or serum. Treatment of cryptococcal menin-
gitis requires induction with intravenous amphotericin B plus flucytosine, followed
by chronic suppression (consolidation and maintenance) with oral fluconazole. At
times, frequent LPs with removal of large volumes of CSF are required to treat the
intracranial hypertension, and CSF shunts may be required.
At very low CD4 counts (< 50 cells/mm3), patients with AIDS are also sus-
ceptible to CMV infections. This can manifest as viremia with persistent fever,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other symptoms, including retinitis, which can lead
to blindness, esophagitis with severe odynophagia; colitis, and necrotizing adrenal-
itis, occasionally leading to adrenal insufficiency. Therapy for severe CMV infec-
tions includes intravenous ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet.
One of the most frequent opportunistic infections occurring in patients with
very low CD4 counts (< 50 cells/mm3) is MAC. The most frequent presentations
include disseminated infection with persistent constitutional symptoms such
as fevers, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as
abdominal pain or chronic watery diarrhea. Diagnosis requires a mycobacterial
blood culture, which can take up to 10 days for positive results; respiratory or stool
cultures have significantly lower sensitivity and specificity. Treatment involves com-
bination therapy, usually beginning with a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithro-
mycin) and ethambutol. The decision to include rifabutin depends on whether the
patient is currently doing well on antiretroviral therapy or has a more severe infec-
tion. Either way, therapy is continued for a minimum of 12 months.
Clinical Presentation
P. jiroveci pneumonia remains the most common opportunistic infection affecting
AIDS patients but often is very difficult to diagnose. The clinical presentation
ranges from mild to severe, typically involving fever, dyspnea, nonproductive cough
for weeks, significant hypoxemia with respiratory compromise, and worsening
fatigue. Some patients experience subjective chills, pleuritic chest pain, and mild
47_Toy-IM_Case46_p475-486.indd 481 03/09/20 9:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,509,"482 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
weight loss. As many as 5% to 10% of patients are asymptomatic. In addition, the
radiographic presentation can be highly variable, ranging from a near-normal chest
film to diffuse bilateral interstitial lung opacities. Lung opacities can progress to
severe alveolar lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) type.
Additionally, lung cysts and pleural effusions are occasionally seen. Lung cysts can
rupture, causing spontaneous pneumothorax. Suspect PJP in patients presenting
with subacute onset of fever, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and HIV/AIDS with-
out PJP prophylaxis.
Laboratory Findings. Definitive diagnosis can be established by use of Giemsa,
direct fluorescence antibody, silver stain, or polymerase chain reaction of sputum
or bronchoalveolar lavage. Sputum induction using aerosolized hypertonic saline
increases sensitivity. Elevated serum LDH levels may be used as an indirect marker
for PJP, although it is nonspecific and may also be elevated in disseminated histo-
plasmosis or lymphoma. Increasing LDH in the setting of therapy predicts poor
prognosis. However, an LDH level less than 220 IU/L is a negative predictor of
having PJP. Similarly, in patients with a CD4 count greater than 250 cells/mm3
or those currently taking PJP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX, the diagnosis of PJP
should be considered highly unlikely.
Determining the oxygenation levels of patients with PJP via ABG significantly
affects prognosis and therapy. Patients with arterial PO less than 70 mm Hg or
2
A-a gradient more than 35 mm Hg have significant disease and benefit from the
simultaneous use of corticosteroids and antimicrobial therapy.
Treatment
The usual treatment for PJP is TMP-SMX. Alternative therapies for those with
sulfa allergies include inhaled pentamidine, clindamycin with primaquine, dapsone,
or atovaquone.
HAART includes a combination of at least three drugs, often consisting of two
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) along with either a nonnucleo-
side reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor, or integrase inhib-
itor. HAART is very potent and has dramatically revolutionized the treatment of
HIV, producing suppression of viral replication and allowing a patient’s CD4 count
to recover. Initiation of HAART is usually indicated for all HIV-infected patients
at their diagnosis, regardless of being asymptomatic or current immune status.
However, initiation of HAART is not always possible in acutely ill patients
because the medications often cause side effects that can be confused with the
underlying disease process. Additionally, within 1 to 2 months of starting HAART,
worsening of clinical symptoms can occur despite increasing CD4 count, termed
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), as a result of newly awak-
ened host responses. Therefore, it may be preferable to initiate antiretroviral ther-
apy within 2 weeks of presentation, while consulting an infectious disease expert
and establishing reliable follow-up. Guidelines indicate that HAART should be
restarted in all AIDS patients within 2 weeks except in cases of cryptococcal men-
ingitis, which requires a delay.
Prevention. Because of the frequency and severity of common opportunistic
infections, antimicrobial prophylaxis is routinely given as a patient’s immune status
47_Toy-IM_Case46_p475-486.indd 482 03/09/20 9:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,510,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 483
declines. With CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 and a detectable viral load,
PJP prophylaxis with either daily or three times a week TMP-SMX is recom-
mended. When CD4 counts fall under 100 cells/mm3 and patients have a posi-
tive Toxoplasma serology, toxoplasmosis should be prevented with daily dosing
of TMP-SMX. If CD4 levels are less than 50 cells/mm3, a MAC prophylactic
regimen with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily or azithromycin 1200 mg weekly
should be started; the current guidelines do not recommend prophylaxis against
MAC if the patients take HAART.

46.3 A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (on insulin),
chronic kidney disease stage III, and HIV (not adherent to HAART) is noted
to have a CD4 count of 180 cells/mm3 during a visit to her primary care
provider. Multiple attempts at starting HAART have failed in the past, but
she states that she is now ready to start. She is hemodynamically stable with
vital signs showing temperature 37 °C, BP 127/73 mm Hg, HR 86 bpm,

46.4 A 36-year-old man with a medical history of HIV (not on HAART; CD4
count of 120 cells/mm3) presents with a worsening headache rated 8 on a
scale of 0 to 10 and a fever for the last 1 day. His vital signs on presenta-
tion are the following: temperature 38 °C, BP 110/58 mm Hg, HR 101 bpm,
RR 16 breaths/min, and SpO 97% on room air. A CT of his brain is
2
performed and reveals multiple 2-cm solitary lesions. He is started on
TMP-SMX with clinical improvement and discharged home with sched-
uled follow-up in 1 week. Instead, he presents 4 weeks later, brought in by
his family after collapsing with a seizure at dinner. The patient is hemody-
namically stable. A repeat CT is performed showing the same 2-cm solitary
lesions. His wife states that he has been adherent with medications. Which
of the following is the next best step?
A. Change therapy to sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine
B. Initiate high-dose methotrexate and glucocorticoids and restart HAART
C. Initiate high-dose methotrexate and glucocorticoids, but delay HAART
to avoid IRIS
D. Perform a stereotactic biopsy of the lesion to determine etiology
ANSWERS
46.1 D. The fever, dry cough, and dyspnea are consistent with PJP, which is diag-
nosed by silver stain or DFA of the sputum. Sometimes, bronchoalveolar
lavage is necessary to obtain adequate samples. Sputum Gram stain (answer B)
is useful when there is suspicion for a lobar community-acquired pneumonia
most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is more likely to
have an acute onset. Acid-fast smear of the sputum (answer A) would help
diagnose TB; the absence of clinical clues such as unintentional weight loss,
chronic night sweats, and sometimes blood-tinged sputum makes this diag-
nosis less likely. Cryptococcus (answer C) is more likely to present with CNS
involvement (ie, meningitis).
47_Toy-IM_Case46_p475-486.indd 484 03/09/20 9:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,512,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 485
46.2 D. The same organisms that cause community-acquired pneumonia in immu-
nocompetent individuals can cause pneumonia in patients living with HIV.
Since Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common isolate in adult patients
with community-acquired pneumonia, it is therefore the most likely etiol-
ogy. Additionally, HIV patients may be more susceptible to encapsulated
organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
The fact that symptoms started 2 days ago makes M. tuberculosis (answer B)
less likely since it is more of an indolent illness. Disseminated histoplasmosis
(answer A) may affect HIV-infected patients as an opportunistic infection
and usually manifests as fever, fatigue, chest pain, and respiratory distress;
this organism, while found in HIV-infected patients, is not as common as
pneumococcal pneumonia. Last, PJP (answer C) tends to present with non-
productive cough and hypoxia, which is not described in this patient.
46.3 C. All HIV-positive patients should be recommended HAART therapy at
the time of diagnosis, except in the case of current cryptococcal meningitis.
The three-drug therapy consists of two nucleoside (or nucleotide) reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and either one integrase inhibitor, one
NNRTI, or one protease inhibitor (thus eliminating answer choices A, B, D,
and E). In addition to starting HAART, this patient should receive PJP pro-
phylaxis since her CD4 count is less than 200 cells/mm3. The most common
treatment for patients who can tolerate sulfa drugs is TMP-SMX.
46.4 D. This patient should have a biopsy; this is indicated when there is nonre-
sponse to empiric therapy after 14 days. The most common cause of a mass
lesion of the brain in an HIV patient is toxoplasmosis, which is treated with
TMP-SMX or sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. However, since this patient
failed to show clinical improvement after treatment and still possesses 2-cm
brain lesions, primary CNS lymphoma should escalate to the top of the dif-
ferential diagnosis list. A brain biopsy is diagnostic in that case. Answer A
(changing to sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine) would be inappropriate with-
out first ensuring there is no CNS lymphoma. Methotrexate, glucocorticoids,
and HAART (answer B) may be a consideration for treating CNS lymphoma,
although therapy should not be started without tissue diagnosis. Answer C
(methotrexate and steroids without HAART to avoid IRIS) is not indicated.
Note that IRIS is a worsening of the neurologic function during the first
60 days of antiretroviral therapy thought to be due to enhanced immune
function.

CLINICAL PEARLS
Pneumocystis pneumonia typically has a subacute presentation with
»
fever, a dry cough, and new shortness of breath in HIV patients with a
CD4 count lower than 200 cells/mm3 who are not on PJP prophylaxis
(TMP-SMX).
Patients with PJP can present with a normal chest x-ray, discrete bilateral
»
interstitial lung opacities, or diffuse severe alveolar lung opacities (ARDS
type) and typically have an elevated serum lactic acid dehydrogenase level.
Pulmonary TB should always be considered in AIDS patients with respira-
»
tory symptoms and suggestive history; its radiographic presentation may
be atypical, and signs and symptoms of dissemination are more common
than in immunocompetent patients.
The most frequent isolate in bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients is
»
S. pneumoniae.
In patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3, TMP-SMX prophy-
»
laxis is effective in preventing Pneumocystis pneumonia and in prevent-
ing toxoplasmosis when the CD4 count is less than 100 cells/mm3.
When the CD4 is less than 50 cells/mm3, clarithromycin or azithromycin
»
are indicated to prevent MAC infection in patients not taking HAART.
HAART is effective in reducing viral replication, increasing CD4 counts,
»
and restoring immunocompetence. With the exception of C. neoformans
meningitis, it should not be delayed.
HAART consists of a three-drug treatment: two NRTIs plus one integrase
»
inhibitor, one NNRTI, or one protease inhibitor.

A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department (ED) by her
family for increasing confusion and lethargy over the past week. She was recently
diagnosed with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer but has not begun cancer
treatment. She has been afebrile and has not had any illnesses. She is not taking
any medications. Her blood pressure is 136/82 mm Hg, heart rate is 84 beats
per minute (bpm), and respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute and unlabored.
On examination, she is an elderly woman who is difficult to arouse and reacts
only to painful stimuli. She is able to move her extremities without apparent
motor deficits, and her deep tendon reflexes are decreased symmetrically. The
remainder of her examination is normal, with normal jugular venous pressure
and no extremity edema. You order some laboratory tests, which reveal a serum
sodium level of 108 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mEq/L, blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) 5 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.5 mg/dL. Serum osmolality is
220 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality is 400 mOsm/kg. Urine sodium concentration

Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate
Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone
Summary: A 65-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer presents with
Increasing confusion and lethargy over the past week, but no focal deficit

Normal temperature and blood pressure

No edema or jugular venous distention

Symmetrically decreased deep tendon reflexes

Significant hyponatremia and low serum osmolality, with unexpectedly high urine

osmolality
No masses or hydrocephalus on brain CT scan

Most likely diagnosis: Coma/lethargy secondary to severe hyponatremia, which
is most likely caused by a paraneoplastic syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
Next therapeutic step: Treat the hyponatremia with hypertonic saline.
Most serious complication of this therapy: Osmotic demyelination syndrome,
formerly referred to as central pontine myelinolysis.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. List the causes of hyponatremia. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Understand the use of laboratory testing in the diagnosis of hyponatremia.
(EPA 3)
3. Describe the treatment of hyponatremia and some of the potential complica-
tions of therapy. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
This 65-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer presents in a stuporous state
with hypotonic hyponatremia. She appears euvolemic, as she does not have find-
ings suggestive of either volume overload (jugular venous distention or peripheral
edema) or volume depletion (diminished skin turgor). Of note, the term volemia
refers to intravascular volume. In this chapter, we use volemia to represent total
body sodium (in this case, both variables are not coincident all the time). She has
no focal neurologic deficits or apparent masses on CT scan of the brain suggesting
cerebral metastases. The most likely cause of her altered mental status is hypona-
tremia. The patient does not take medications. Thus, in the situation of hypotonic
hyponatremia in a euvolemic state and with inappropriately concentrated urine,
the most likely etiology is inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) produced
by the lung cancer. Therapy is guided by the severity of the hyponatremia and the
48_Toy-IM_Case47_p487-496.indd 488 03/09/20 9:01 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,516,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 489
symptoms. Because this individual is stuporous and the sodium level is severely
decreased, hypertonic saline is required with fairly rapid partial correction. This
therapy is not benign and requires monitoring in the intensive care unit. Also, the
goal is not correction of the sodium level to normal (135 mmol/L) but rather an
increase in serum sodium concentration by 4 to 6 mmol/L in 24 hours.
APPROACH TO:
Hyponatremia
DEFINITIONS
ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE: The posterior pituitary hormone that controls
excretion of free water and thus, indirectly, sodium concentration and serum tonic-
ity. Also referred to as arginine vasopressin.
OSMOLALITY: Concentration of osmotically active particles, which draw water
into a compartment; the normal range for serum osmolality is 280 to 300 mOsm/kg.
SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE SECRETION OF ANTIDIURETIC
HORMONE: Nonphysiologic elevation of ADH levels as a consequence of ectopic
production, as in malignancy, or stimulation of excess pituitary production by vari-
ous pulmonary or central nervous system (CNS) diseases.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level < 135 mmol/L and is, by far, the
most common electrolyte disturbance among hospitalized patients. Patients are often
asymptomatic, especially if the hyponatremia develops slowly. Depending on how
rapidly the hyponatremia develops, most patients do not have symptoms until the
serum sodium level is in the low 120 mmol/L range. Note: since sodium is a mon-
ovalent cation, 1 mmol/L = 1 mEq/L.
Serum sodium concentrations are important because they almost always reflect
tonicity, the effect of extracellular fluid on cells that will cause the cells (eg, brain
cells) to swell (hypotonicity) or to shrink (hypertonicity). For purposes of this dis-
cussion, we use serum osmolality as an indicator of tonicity.
Hypotonic hyponatremia always occurs because there is water gain, that is,
impairment of free water excretion. If one considers that the normal kidney capac-
ity to excrete free water is approximately 18 to 20 L/d, it becomes apparent that
it is very difficult to overwhelm this capacity solely through excessive water intake,
as in psychogenic polydipsia. Therefore, when hyponatremia develops, the kidney
is usually holding on to free water, either pathologically, as in SIADH, or physi-
ologically, as an attempt to maintain effective circulating volume when patients are
significantly volume depleted. Hyponatremia can also occur in cases of sodium loss,
for example, as a consequence of diuretic use or because of aldosterone deficiency.
However, in those cases, there is then a secondary gain of free water.
48_Toy-IM_Case47_p487-496.indd 489 03/09/20 9:01 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,517,"490 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
To determine the cause of the hypotonic hyponatremia, the health care provider
must clinically assess the volume status of the patient by history and physical exami-
nation. A useful algorithm for assessment of patients with hyponatremia is seen in
Figure 47–1. Please note that the figure uses the term volemia. Though less com-
monly used, the “volume status” we refer to is actually “total body sodium.” A more
comfortable way to name the issue at stake is “interstitial volume status.”
A history of vomiting, diarrhea, or other losses, such as profuse sweating, sug-
gests hypovolemia, as do flat neck veins, dry oral mucous membranes, and dimin-
ished urine output. In cases of significant hypovolemia, there is a physiologic
increase in ADH in an attempt to retain free water to maintain circulating volume,
even at the expense of hypotonicity. In these cases, the excess ADH is not “inap-
propriate” as in SIADH, but extremely appropriate. At this point, one can check
the urinary sodium levels. In hypovolemia, the kidney should be avidly retaining
sodium, so the urine sodium level should be less than 20 mmol/L. If the patient is
hypovolemic, yet the urine sodium level is more than 20 mmol/L, then the kidneys
do not have the ability to retain sodium normally. In this case, kidney function is
impaired by the use of diuretics, the kidney is lacking necessary hormonal stimula-
tion as in adrenal insufficiency, or there is a primary renal problem, such as tubular
damage from acute tubular necrosis. When patients are hypovolemic, treatment of
the hyponatremia requires correction of the volume status, usually replacement with
isotonic (0.9%) saline.
Hypervolemia is usually apparent as edema or elevated jugular venous pressure.
It commonly occurs as a result of heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or nephrotic
syndrome. In these edematous disorders, there is usually a total body excess of both
sodium and water, yet arterial baroreceptors perceive hypoperfusion or a decrease
in intravascular volume, which leads to an increase in the level of ADH and, there-
fore, retention of free water by the kidneys. Renal failure itself can lead to hypo-
tonic hyponatremia because of an inability to excrete dilute urine. In any of these
cases, the usual initial treatment of hyponatremia is administration of diuretics to
reduce excess salt and water.
Thus, hypovolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia is often apparent clinically
and often does not present a diagnostic challenge. Euvolemic hyponatremia,
however, is a frequent problem that is not so easily diagnosed. Once the clinician
has diagnosed the patient with euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia, the next step is
to measure the urine osmolality. This measurement is taken to determine whether
the kidney is actually capable of excreting the free water normally (urine osmolality
should be maximally dilute, < 100 mOsm/kg) or whether the free water excretion
is impaired (urine not maximally diluted, > 100 mOsm/kg). If the urine is maxi-
mally diluted, it is handling free water normally, but its capacity for excretion has
been overwhelmed, as in central polydipsia. More commonly, free water excretion
is impaired, and the urine is not maximally diluted as it should be.
Two important diagnoses must be considered at this point: hypothyroidism and
adrenal insufficiency. Thyroid hormone and cortisol both are permissive for free water
excretion, so their deficiency causes water retention. Cortisol deficiency in second-
ary (pituitary) adrenal insufficiency can mimic SIADH. In contrast, patients with
primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) may also lack aldosterone, so they

have impaired ability to retain sodium and often appear hypovolemic and may even
present in shock.
Euvolemic hyponatremia is most commonly caused by SIADH. However, as men-
tioned, Addison disease and hypothyroidism should also be considered as potential
causes of euvolemic hyponatremia (it should be noted that forms of Addison disease
that impair both cortisol and aldosterone production will present with hypovole-
mia, while those that affect only cortisol production will present with euvolemia).
Clinical Presentation
Nonphysiologic, nonosmotically mediated (therefore “inappropriate”) secretion
can occur in the setting of pulmonary disease, CNS disease, pain, in the postopera-
tive period, or as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Because of retention of free
water, patients actually have mild (although clinically insignificant) volume expan-
sion. Additionally, if they have a normal dietary sodium intake, the kidneys do not
retain sodium avidly. Therefore, modest natriuresis occurs so that the urine sodium
level is elevated > 40 mmol/L.
SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion: The patient must be hypoosmolar but euvolemic,
with urine that is not maximally dilute (osmolality > 100 mOsm/L), urine sodium
more than 40 mmol/L, and normal adrenal and thyroid function. Some laboratory
clues to SIADH are low blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and low uric acid levels.
The clinical manifestations are related to osmotic water shifts leading to cerebral
edema; thus, the symptoms are mainly neurologic. Early symptoms include head-
ache, nausea, and vomiting; later symptoms may progress to lethargy, confusion,
seizures, or coma.
Treatment
Unless the patient has severe neurologic symptoms, the usual initial treatment of
SIADH is free water restriction. Patients with severe neurologic symptoms, such as
seizures or coma, require rapid partial correction of the sodium level. The treat-
ment of choice is hypertonic (eg, 3%) saline. When there is concern that the saline
infusion might cause volume overload, the infusion can be administered with a
loop diuretic such as furosemide. The diuretic will cause the excretion of hypotonic
urine that is essentially “half-normal saline,” so a greater portion of sodium than
water will be retained, helping to correct the serum sodium level.
For patients with chronic hypervolemic hyponatremia, as in heart failure or cir-
rhosis, vasopressin antagonists (tolvaptan and conivaptan are approved for use in
the United States) are now available and are very effective in increasing free water
excretion and raising serum sodium concentrations. Therapy with these agents is
initiated in the hospital with close monitoring of sodium concentration.
Complications
When hyponatremia occurs for any reason, especially when it occurs slowly, the
brain adapts to prevent cerebral edema. Solutes leave the intracellular compartment
of the brain over hours to days, so patients may have few neurologic symptoms
despite very low serum sodium levels. If the serum sodium level is corrected rapidly,
the brain does not have time to readjust, and it may shrink rapidly as it loses fluid to
48_Toy-IM_Case47_p487-496.indd 492 03/09/20 9:01 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,520,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 493
the extracellular space. It is believed that this rapid shrinkage may trigger demyelin-
ation of the cerebellar and pontine neurons. This osmotic demyelination syndrome
may cause quadriplegia, pseudobulbar palsies, a “locked-in” syndrome, coma, or death.
Demyelination can occur even when fluid restriction is the treatment used to correct
the serum sodium level. For any patient with hyponatremia, the general rule is that
chronic hyponatremia should be corrected slowly, and acutely developing hypona-
tremia can be corrected more quickly. In chronic hyponatremia, the serum sodium
concentration should be corrected no faster than 4 to 6 mEq/L in the first 24 hours.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
47.1 A 24-year-old man developed seizures 12 hours after an emergent splenec-
tomy, which he required after a motor vehicle collision. After a search for
etiology, he was found to have a serum sodium level of 116 mEq/L. He was
treated with intravenous hypertonic saline; after 3 hours, the serum sodium
level was 120 mEq/L. Which of the following factors most likely led to his
hyponatremia?
A. Postoperatively inappropriate elevation of serum vasopressin
B. Administration of hypertonic solutions
C. Acute kidney injury
D. Seizure-induced hyponatremia
47.2 A 56-year-old man presents to the doctor for the first time complaining of
fatigue and weight loss. He has never had any health problems, but he has
smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for about 35 years. He is a day laborer
and is currently homeless and living in a shelter. His physical examination
is notable for a low-to-normal blood pressure, skin hyperpigmentation, and
digital clubbing. He appears euvolemic. You tell him you are not sure of the
problem as yet, but you will draw some blood tests and schedule him for
follow-up in a week. The laboratory calls you that night and informs you that
the patient’s sodium level is 126 mEq/L, potassium level is 6.7 mEq/L, cre-
atinine level is normal, and bicarbonate and chloride levels are low. Which of
the following is the likely cause of his hyponatremia given his presentation?
A. SIADH
B. Hypothyroidism
C. Gastrointestinal losses
D. Adrenal insufficiency
E. Renal insufficiency

47.3 An 83-year-old woman comes to your clinic complaining of a headache and
mild confusion. Her medical history is remarkable only for hypertension,
which is well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. Her examination and
laboratory tests show no signs of infection, but her serum sodium level is
119 mEq/L, and plasma osmolality is 245 mOsm/kg. She confides that she
has been drinking and eating less since her husband passed away 4 months
ago. She appears to be clinically hypovolemic. Which of the following is the
best initial therapy?
A. Fluid restriction
B. Infusion of 0.9% saline
C. Infusion of 3% saline
D. Infusion of 3% saline with furosemide
47.4 A 58-year-old man has undergone a lengthy colon cancer surgery. On the
first postoperative day, he is noted to have hyponatremia with a sodium level
of 128 mEq/L. You suspect that the hyponatremia is due to the intravenous
infusion of hypotonic solution. Which of the following laboratory findings
best supports your diagnosis?
A. Urine sodium > 20 mmol/L
B. Urine osmolality > 200 mOsm/L
C. Serum osmolality < 280 mOsm/kg
D. Serum potassium > 5 mmol/L
ANSWERS
47.1 A. In the postoperative state or in situations where the patient is in pain,
the serum vasopressin level may rise, leading to inappropriate retention of
free water, which leads to dilution of the serum. Concomitant administra-
tion of hypotonic fluids (not hypertonic, as in answer B) may exacerbate
the situation. Acute kidney injury (answer C) may lead to mild hyponatre-
mia due to inability to excrete free water; usually, the sodium level will be
> 125 mmol/L. Seizures (answer D) are likely a result of this patient’s hypo-
natremia, rather than causing the low sodium; in fact, seizures are more likely
to lead to hypernatremia.
47.2 D. Hyponatremia in the setting of hyperkalemia and acidosis (low bicar-
bonate level) is suspicious for adrenal insufficiency. This patient’s exami-
nation is also suggestive of the diagnosis, given his complaints of fatigue,
weight loss, low blood pressure, and hyperpigmentation. The diagnosis is
made by an early morning cortisol test or by measuring the response to
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation, showing low corti-
sol levels. In this case, the cause of the adrenal gland destruction is prob-
ably due to either tuberculosis or metastatic lung cancer. As a reminder,
some forms of Addison disease can cause reduced production of cortisol
and aldosterone, which can present as a hyponatremic hypovolemia, while
48_Toy-IM_Case47_p487-496.indd 494 03/09/20 9:01 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,522,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 495
forms that affect cortisol production only will present with hyponatremic
euvolemia. SIADH (answer A) and hypothyroidism (answer B) do not lead
to hyperpigmentation, low blood pressure, hyperkalemia, or acidosis. Gas-
trointestinal fluid losses (answer C) also would not lead to hyperpigmenta-
tion; furthermore, the electrolyte derangements would be hypokalemia and
alkalosis with diarrhea. Renal insufficiency (answer E) would not be associ-
ated with hyperpigmentation or digital clubbing.
47.3 B. Because the patient is hypovolemic, probably as a result of the use of
diuretics, volume replacement with isotonic saline is the best initial therapy.
Hyponatremia caused by thiazide diuretics can occur by several mecha-
nisms, including volume depletion. It is most common in elderly women.
Volume replacement takes precedence over sodium correction (answers C
and D). A fluid restriction (answer A) would be inappropriate at this time.
47.4 C. In a patient with hyponatremia due to the infusion of excessive hypotonic
solution, the serum osmolarity should be low. When responding normally,
the kidneys should attempt to retain sodium and excrete water; hence, the
urine sodium concentration should be low, and the urine osmolality should
be low (not high, as in answer B). When the infusion of hypotonic solution is
used, the serum potassium level will also be low. This is in contrast to a situ-
ation of mineralocorticoid deficiency, in which the serum sodium level will be
decreased (answer A) and potassium level may be elevated (answer D). Simi-
larly, hyperaldosteronism can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia (Conn
syndrome). In summary, while a low serum osmolality is common to many
possible diagnoses, the alternative answers are clearly wrong, because in
essence, the kidneys will be excreting free water.

A 38-year-old woman presents to your clinic for evaluation of menstrual irregularity.
She states that her periods started when she was 12 years old, and they have
been fairly regular ever since, coming once every 28 to 30 days. She has had three
previous uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. However, approximately
9 months ago, her cycles seemed to lengthen, and for the last 3 months she has
not had a period at all. She stopped breastfeeding 3 years ago, but over the last
3 months she noticed that she could express a small amount of milky fluid from her
breasts. She had a bilateral tubal ligation after her last pregnancy, and she has no
other medical or surgical history. She takes no medications except multivitamins.
Over the last year or so, she thinks she has gained about 10 lb, and she feels as if
she has no energy despite adequate sleep. She has noticed some mild thinning
of her hair and slightly more coarse skin texture. She denies headaches or visual
changes. Her physical examination, including pelvic and breast examinations, are
normal. She is not obese or hirsute. Slight whitish nipple discharge is elicited from
her breasts. Her pregnancy test is negative.

Oligomenorrhea Caused by Hypothyroidism and
Hyperprolactinemia
Summary: A 38-year-old woman presents with
Oligomenorrhea and now secondary amenorrhea, along with galactorrhea

Weight gain, fatigue, mild thinning of her hair, and slightly more coarse skin

No headaches or visual changes, which might suggest a pituitary adenoma

Normal pelvic and breast examinations

No obesity or hirsutism; last pregnancy 3 years ago and not breast-feeding

Slight whitish nipple discharge

Most likely diagnosis: Oligomenorrhea and galactorrhea due to hypothyroidism.
Most likely etiology: Primary hypothyroidism is the most likely diagnosis, most
often due to autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the differential diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea and the
approach to the investigation of possible hormonal causes. (EPA 2, 3)
2. Understand the interactions of the hormones involved in the hypothalamic-
pituitary-gonadal axis. (EPA 12)
3. Recognize the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of hypothyroidism.
(EPA 1, 3)
4. Describe the treatment of hypothyroidism. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This 38-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhea, weight gain, fatigue,
and galactorrhea despite having previously normal menses and discontinuing
breastfeeding 3 years ago. Her history of fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss suggests
a systemic cause of her symptoms, possibly hypothyroidism. However, her normal
physical examination with lack of myxedema or bradycardia, normal reflexes, nor-
mal cognition, and nondisplaced point of maximal impulse suggest mild hypothy-
roidism. Lack of virilization or obesity does not exclude polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS), but their absence makes this diagnosis less likely. Hypothyroidism alone
could be the cause of the galactorrhea because elevated thryoid releasing hormone
can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Prolactinomas can also cause galactorrhea as well
as secondary amenorrhea, however, and should be excluded.

APPROACH TO:
Oligomenorrhea and Hypothyroidism
DEFINITIONS
AMENORRHEA: Primary—Absence of menarche by the age of 15 regardless of
the presence or absence of secondary sex characteristics. Secondary—Absence of
menstruation for 3 or more months in women with normal past menses.
GALACTORRHEA: Any discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast;
may be unilateral or bilateral and may appear clear, milky, or bloody.
OLIGOMENORRHEA: Menses occurring at infrequent intervals of more than
35 days or fewer than nine menses per year.
POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME: Syndrome characterized by infertility,
hirsutism, obesity, and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea and often clinically signifi-
cant insulin resistance.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO OLIGOMENORRHEA
Pathophysiology
The assessment of oligomenorrhea is similar to the workup for secondary amenor-
rhea, with the understanding that secondary amenorrhea is present when a nor-
mally menstruating woman stops having periods for 3 consecutive months or more.
The most common cause of both symptoms, and the easiest to exclude in the clinic, is
pregnancy. A negative in-clinic pregnancy test should be confirmed with a serum
beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Primary amenorrhea is present when
the first menses has not appeared in a girl by the age of 15 and is generally caused
by a variety of genetic or congenital defects. It is commonly associated with disor-
ders of puberty. Given this patient’s age and history, primary amenorrhea is not a
consideration; thus, a diagnostic pathway for secondary amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea
should be undertaken (Figure 48–1).
Problems of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian Axis. Excluding pregnancy
and problems in the genital outflow tract, disorders of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-ovarian axis account for the largest number of cases of oligomenorrhea
and amenorrhea. Disorders of the hypothalamus account for the largest percent-
age of abnormality (> 45%); these include problems of nutrition (rapid weight
loss/anorexia), excessive exercise, stress, and infiltrative diseases (eg, craniopharyn-
gioma, sarcoidosis, histiocytosis).
PCOS. The largest single cause of oligomenorrhea is PCOS, accounting for 30%
of all cases. PCOS was once thought to be a disease originating in the ovary; how-
ever, it now is known that PCOS is a much more complicated neuroendocrine disor-
der with evidence of estrogenization, as well as insulin resistance. The diagnosis is
a clinical one (anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and small follicles on the ovary on
ultrasound) after ruling out other causes. These women often have glucose intol-
erance and may develop metabolic syndrome. They are at risk for cardiovascular

disease and endometrial cancer. Treatment for PCOS includes weight loss (via diet
and exercise), oral contraceptives, androgen blockers such as spironolactone, and
metformin. Clomiphene citrate or letrozole can be used as a fertility treatment to
induce ovulation in patients looking to get pregnant.
Other Causes. Other important causes of amenorrhea include diseases of the
pituitary, specifically neoplasms (eg, prolactinomas, functioning or nonfunction-
ing adenomas), which account for 18% of cases. Empty sella syndrome, caused
by cerebrospinal fluid herniation into the pituitary fossa, and Sheehan syndrome,
caused by severe obstetric hemorrhage and/or maternal hypotension at delivery,
are important causes of atrophy and ischemia of the pituitary. If suspected, they
should be investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, disorders
such as premature ovarian failure (loss of all functional ovarian follicles before the
age of 40), diseases of the thyroid, and adult-onset adrenal hyperplasia should be
considered and investigated if supported by history and physical examination with
the appropriate laboratory studies (Table 48–1).
Hypothyroidism. The history and physical examination will narrow the range
of possible causes. In this patient, the history of fatigue, weight gain, and galac-
torrhea, along with previously normal menses and a normal physical examination,
place hypothyroidism at the top of the list. In primary hypothyroidism, the hypo-
thalamus increases thyrotropin-releasing hormone, which also stimulates prolac-
tin secretion. Measurement of both thyroid hormone and prolactin levels would
be indicated in this case. Prolactinomas are the most common functional pituitary
tumors in both men and women and should be suspected if the prolactin level is
markedly elevated, > 200 µg/L. If prolactin levels are markedly elevated, pituitary

imaging with MRI is indicated. Hyperprolactinemia from any cause inhibits hypo-
thalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, leading to amen-
orrhea in women and infertility and diminished libido in men. In the workup of
secondary amenorrhea, these two diagnoses are the easiest to start with because
the tests are noninvasive and relatively inexpensive.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO HYPOTHYROIDISM
Pathophysiology
Hypothyroidism is defined as the insufficient production of thyroid hormone.
Secondary hypothyroidism as a result of dysfunction of hypothalamic and pitu-
itary hormone secretion is much less common but should be suspected in a patient
with a history suggestive of Sheehan syndrome or with symptoms or signs of a
tumor in the region of the sella. Ninety-five percent of cases of hypothyroidism are
caused by primary thyroid gland failure, resulting in insufficient thyroid hormone
production. In the United States, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is auto-
immune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, in which cytotoxic antibodies are produced, lead-
ing to thyroid atrophy and fibrosis. The next most common cause is surgical or
radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism, or Graves disease. Worldwide,
iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goitrous (enlarged thyroid) hypothy-
roidism, but in the United States, this is rare.
Clinical Presentation
Most hypothyroid patients present with vague and nonspecific symptoms. Elderly
individuals may be suspected of having dementia or depression when the cause is
really hypothyroidism. In general, symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, muscle cramp-
ing, cold intolerance, hair thinning, menstrual changes, or carpal tunnel syndrome
are common and should prompt an investigation of thyroid function.
Laboratory Values. When testing outpatients for hypothyroidism, measurement
of the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is the most sensitive and use-
ful test. Because most cases of hypothyroidism are caused by thyroid gland failure,
the normal pituitary response is to markedly increase the TSH levels in an attempt
to stimulate the failing gland. Falling levels of thyroid hormone lead to an increase
in the TSH concentration. Measurement of TSH alone would be insufficient in sus-
pected cases of pituitary disease, so measurement of the thyroid hormone level can
also be performed. One should remember that almost all thyroxine (T ) circulates
4
bound to protein, but it is the free or unbound fraction that is able to diffuse into
cells and become active. Most laboratories can now measure free T directly, or it
4
can be estimated by using the free thyroxine index (FTI). The FTI is calculated
from measurements of total T and the triiodothyronine (T ) resin uptake test.
4 3
When there is excess thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), as in pregnancy or oral
contraceptive use, T levels will be high (as a consequence of the large amount of
4
carrier protein), but T uptake will be low (value varies inversely with amount of
3
TBG present). Conversely, when there is a low level of TBG, as in a hypoprotein-
emic patient with nephrotic syndrome, the T level will necessarily also be low (not
4
49_Toy-IM_Case48_p497-506.indd 502 03/09/20 9:08 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,530,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 503
much carrier protein), but the T uptake will be high. If both total T and T uptake
3 4 3
are low, the FTI is low, and the patient is hypothyroid.
In mild cases, or subclinical hypothyroidism, the TSH level is mildly elevated,
but the free T or FTI is within the normal range. Patients may be asymptom-
4
atic or report the vague and subtle symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue.
About half of such patients will progress to overt hypothyroidism within 5 years.
They often have some derangement of cholesterol metabolism, such as elevated total
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thyroid hormone replacement can be pre-
scribed in the cases of TSH > 10 mU/L, pregnancy, infertility, and/or strongly con-
vincing symptoms of hypothyroidism. In clinical hypothyroidism, the TSH level is
markedly elevated, and the free T or FTI is low.
4
Treatment
The overwhelming majority of patients with hypothyroidism can be treated with
once-daily dosing of synthetic levothyroxine, which is biochemically identical to
the natural hormone. Levothyroxine is relatively inexpensive; has a long half-life
(6–7 days), which allows once-daily dosing; and gives a predictable response. Older
thyroid preparations, such as desiccated thyroid extract, are available but are not
favored because of the variable content of T and T in each tablet.
3 4
If there is no residual thyroid function, the daily replacement dose of levothy-
roxine is 1.6 µg/kg, which usually calculates to 100 to 150 µg. However, in older
patients and in those with known cardiovascular disease, dosing should start at a
lower level, such as 25 to 50 µg/d, and be increased at similar increments once every
4 to 6 weeks until the patient achieves a euthyroid state. Overly rapid replacement
with the sudden increase in metabolic rate can overwhelm the coronary or cardiac
reserve. The goal of treatment is normalized TSH, ideally in the lower half of
the reference range. Patients may not experience full relief of symptoms until
3 to 6 months after normal TSH is achieved.
Complications
In severe, prolonged hypothyroidism, a syndrome termed myxedema may develop.
These patients present with hypothermia, hypotension, hypoventilation, altered
mental status, hyponatremia, and/or hypoglycemia. They may also have underlying
adrenal insufficiency. This is a life-threatening emergency with a high mortality,

underlying adrenal insufficiency) followed by intravenous levothyroxine.

tion. On examination, you note neck fullness. When you palpate her thyroid,
it is enlarged, smooth, rubbery, and nontender. The patient is asymptomatic.
You send her for thyroid function testing. Her T , free T , and T are normal,
4 4 3
but her TSH is slightly elevated. Which of the following is the most likely
diagnosis?
A. Iodine deficiency
B. Thyroid cancer
C. Hashimoto thyroiditis
D. Graves disease
E. Multinodular goiter
48.2 Which of the following laboratory tests is most appropriate to be performed
to confirm your diagnosis of the patient in Question 48.1?
A. Repeat thyroid function tests
B. Thyroid ultrasound
C. Nuclear thyroid scan
D. Antithyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) antibody tests
E. Complete blood count with differential
48.3 A 19-year-old gymnast active in national competition is brought to your
clinic by her mother because the daughter’s menses have ceased for the last
3 months. Prior to this, she was always regular. She denies excess dieting,
although she does work out with her team 3 hours daily. Her physical exami-
nation is normal except for her body mass index of 20 kg/m2. Which of the
following laboratory tests should be ordered first?

48.4 A 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 4 weeks ago
presents to your clinic complaining of persistent feelings of fatigue and slug-
gishness. After confirming your diagnosis with a measurement of the TSH,
you started her on levothyroxine 50 µg daily. She has been reading about her
diagnosis on the Internet and wants to try desiccated thyroid extract instead
of the medicine you gave her. On examination, she weighs 175 lb, her heart
rate is 64 beats per minute (bpm) at rest, and her blood pressure is normal.
Which of the following is the best explanation to be conveyed to the patient?
A. The delay in resolution of symptoms is to be expected.
B. Thyroid extract is approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) but inconsistent in activity.
C. Her dose of levothyroxine should be increased.
D. She should take a multivitamin with iron for her symptoms.
ANSWERS
48.1 C. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism with
goiter in the United States. It is most commonly found in middle-aged women,
although it can be seen in all age groups. Iodine deficiency (answer A) is exceed-
ingly uncommon in the United States because of iodized salt. Graves disease
(answer D) is a hyperthyroid condition. Patients with multinodular goiter
(answer E) usually are euthyroid. Patients with thyroid cancer (answer B)
usually are also euthyroid.
48.2 D. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease of the thyroid. Several
different autoantibodies directed toward components of the thyroid gland
will be present in the patient’s serum; however, of these, anti-TPO antibody
almost always is detectable. These antibodies are the markers, not the cause,
of gland destruction. On thyroid biopsy, lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis
of the gland are pathognomonic. The presence of these autoantibodies pre-
dicts progressive gland failure and the need for hormone replacement. None
of the other tests (answer A, repeat thyroid function tests; answer B, thyroid
ultrasound; answer C, nuclear thyroid scan; answer E, complete blood cell
count with differential) will be helpful.
48.3 E. In a young woman with oligomenorrhea, pregnancy should always be the
first diagnosis considered. Urine pregnancy tests are easily performed in the
clinic and are highly sensitive. Serum beta-hCG can be measured to confirm
a negative test. In this patient, the next most likely diagnosis is hypothalamic
hypogonadism, secondary to her strenuous exercise regimen. These young
women are at risk for osteoporosis and should be counseled on adequate
nutrition and offered combined oral contraceptives if the amenorrhea per-
sists. If the pregnancy test is negative, then evaluation of oligomenorrhea
includes TSH (answer A), serum prolactin level (answer D), and serum LH
and FSH (answer C); this patient likely has a hypothalamic dysfunction with
lack of pulsatile GnRH from the excessive exercise and low body weight.
Answer B (complete blood count) is not indicated in this case.
49_Toy-IM_Case48_p497-506.indd 505 03/09/20 9:08 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,533,"506 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
48.4 C. This patient’s thyroid replacement should be increased. She has been on
thyroid replacement therapy for 4 weeks which is sufficient time for a clinical
effect (answer A). The symptoms point to continued hypothyroidism. Levo-
thyroxine is the preferred replacement hormone for hypothyroidism. The
amount of hormone batch to batch and the patient dose response are believed
to be more predictable than with other forms of hormone replacement, such
as thyroid extract (answer B), which is made from desiccated beef or pork
thyroid glands; this preparation is not FDA approved. There is no evidence
that the natural hormone replacement is superior to the synthetic form. The
dose of levothyroxine should be titrated to relief of symptoms, as well as to
normalization of the TSH. Other medications, especially iron-containing
vitamins (answer D), should be taken at different times than levothyroxine
because they may interfere with absorption.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The most common causes of oligomenorrhea are disorders of the
»
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, such as PCOS and hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism may cause hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia
»
from any cause induces hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to menstrual
irregularities in women and diminished libido and infertility in men.
The most common cause of hypothyroidism is primary thyroid gland fail-
»
ure as a result of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
A low free T or FTI and a high TSH characterize primary hypothyroidism.
» 4
Synthetic levothyroxine (T) replacement is the treatment of choice for
» 4
hypothyroidism; in older patients, you need to “start low and go slow.”
The goal of therapy is to normalize the TSH level in primary hypothyroid-
»
ism and to relieve symptoms.

A 58-year-old woman comes to the office after she experienced a near-fainting
spell 1 day ago. She was outside playing tennis when she vomited and felt
lightheaded. She spent the rest of the day lying down with mild, diffuse
abdominal pain and nausea. She had no fever or diarrhea. She reports several
months of worsening fatigue; mild, intermittent, generalized abdominal pain;
and loss of appetite with a 10- to 15-lb unintentional weight loss. Her medical
history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. She
takes no other medications. On examination, her temperature is 99.8 °F, heart rate
is 90 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 89/62 mm Hg, and respiratory
rate is 14 breaths per minute. Upon standing, she becomes lightheaded, her pulse
increases to 112 bpm, and her systolic blood pressure drops to 70 mm Hg. She is
alert and tanned, with hyperpigmented creases in her hands. Her lungs are clear,
and her heart rhythm (after standing) is tachycardic but regular. On abdominal
examination, she has normal bowel sounds and mild diffuse tenderness without
guarding. Her pulses are rapid and thready. She has no peripheral edema. Initial
laboratory studies are significant for sodium 121 mEq/L, potassium 5.8 mEq/L,
bicarbonate 16 mEq/L, glucose 52 mg/dL, and creatinine 2 mg/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 49:
Adrenal Insufficiency
Summary: A 58-year-old woman presents with
Near-fainting episode 1 day ago with vomiting, feeling lightheaded, and abdominal pain

Orthostatic hypotension

Intermittent chronic abdominal pain

Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and unintentional weight loss

Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and hypoglycemia

Hyperpigmented creases in her hands along with darker skin

Most likely diagnosis: Primary adrenal insufficiency. The most common cause of
primary adrenal insufficiency in adults is autoimmune adrenalitis. Her presenta-
tion was likely exacerbated by levothyroxine use.
Next step: After drawing a cortisol level, immediate administration of intravenous
saline with glucose and an intravenous stress dose of corticosteroids.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the presentation of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency
and of adrenal crisis. (EPA 1, 10)
2. Recognize the most common causes of primary and secondary adrenal insuf-
ficiency. (EPA 2)
3. Describe the treatment of adrenal insufficiency. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This patient has a low-grade fever, which may be a feature of adrenal insufficiency
or may signify infection, which can precipitate an adrenal crisis or produce a simi-
lar clinical picture. It is important to diagnose and treat any underlying infection.
Because of the adrenal insufficiency and the aldosterone deficiency, she has volume
depletion, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. Additionally, she has an acute kidney
injury secondary to hypovolemia, as evidenced by her elevated creatinine. Further-
more, she began thyroid hormone replacement (for hypothyroidism) prior to her
office visit; this likely exacerbated the adrenal crisis. Thus, immediate intravenous
replacement with normal saline with 5% glucose is critical. A low serum cortisol
level with the patient’s clinical presentation and without other explanation con-
firms the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

APPROACH TO:
Adrenal Insufficiency
DEFINITIONS
ACTH STIMULATION TEST: An examination to evaluate the cortisol level after
an intravenous (IV) injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; cortico-
tropin). A normal individual should have a sufficient increase in cortisol, whereas
a patient with adrenal insufficiency will have either an insufficient or no cortisol
increase.
ADDISON DISEASE: Failure of the adrenal cortex leading to underproduction
of corticosteroids.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) refers to adrenal failure or destruc-
tion or infiltration of the adrenal glands. The most common cause worldwide is
autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands. Tuberculosis adrenalitis remains a
frequent cause in the developing world. Among children, the most common cause
is congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Other causes include chronic granulomatous
infections (histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis), bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (usually
in the setting of sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation), adrenal
metastases (commonly from lung, breast, or stomach cancers), or X-linked adre-
noleukodystrophy, a genetic disorder with adrenal and neurologic manifestations.
Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) often develop adre-
nal involvement as a result of infection with cytomegalovirus or Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare.
In primary adrenal insufficiency, the glands themselves are destroyed so that the
patient becomes deficient in cortisol and aldosterone. Primary adrenal insufficiency
is a relatively uncommon disease seen in clinical practice. A high level of suspicion,
particularly in individuals who have suggestive signs or symptoms or who are sus-
ceptible by virtue of associated autoimmune disorders or malignancies, must be
maintained. The nonspecific symptoms might otherwise be missed for many years
until a stressful event leads to crisis and death.
Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency are types of central adrenal insuffi-
ciency. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is adrenal failure caused by a lack of ACTH
stimulation from the pituitary gland. Any disease of the pituitary can cause this,
including infectious, malignant, traumatic, or autoimmune etiologies. Tertiary
adrenal insufficiency is adrenal failure from lack of corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone (CRH) secretion from the hypothalamus. Chronic exogenous administra-
tion of corticosteroids preferentially suppresses the hypothalamic CRH secretion.
Because of the widespread use of corticosteroids, tertiary adrenal insufficiency
is relatively common. In both secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiencies, the
50_Toy-IM_Case49_p507-514.indd 509 03/09/20 9:07 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,537,"510 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
renin-angiotensin system usually is able to maintain near-normal levels of aldoste-
rone so that the patient is deficient only in cortisol.
Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of primary adrenal insufficiency depends on the relative
deficiency of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, ACTH excess, and other
associated disorders. An adrenal crisis may present with fatigue, reduced strength,
weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hypotension. Laboratory findings
may include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and azotemia because
of aldosterone deficiency, as well as hypoglycemia and eosinophilia resulting from
cortisol deficiency.
Patients with adrenal insufficiency may go into crisis when stressed by infec-
tion, trauma, or surgery. The clinical features may appear identical to those of septic
shock; the only clues that the cause is adrenal disease may be the hypoglycemia
(blood sugar is often elevated in sepsis) and profound hypotension that is refractory
to administration of pressors but is reversed almost immediately when intravenous
fluids and steroids (preferentially hydrocortisone, which has both glucocorticoid
and mineralocorticoid activity) are given.
Chronic adrenal insufficiency has nonspecific clinical features, such as malaise,
weight loss, chronic fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nau-
sea, and vomiting. A patient may have hypoglycemia and postural hypotension as a
result of volume depletion. Hyperpigmentation is seen over time in primary adrenal
insufficiency; this is caused by elevated melanocyte-stimulating hormone produc-
tion from the pituitary as a by-product of high ACTH levels. It is typically seen as
generalized hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes. It is increased
in sun-exposed areas or over pressure areas, such as elbows and knees, and may
be noted in skin folds. In contrast, patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency
may be pale due to lack of ACTH and its by-products. Additionally, these patients
maintain aldosterone production due to the renin-angiotensin system, despite the
lack of cortisol production. Therefore, volume depletion and hyperkalemia are not
present.
Diagnosis. Cortisol levels show a diurnal variation. Cortisol levels are high in the
morning and low as the day progresses, and levels should be elevated in stressful
situations such as acute medical illness, surgery, or trauma. A morning plasma cor-
tisol level less than or equal to 5 µg/dL in an acutely ill patient is definitive evidence
of adrenal insufficiency. Conversely, a random cortisol level more than 18 µg/dL
usually is interpreted as evidence of intact adrenal function. As in other endocrine
deficiency states, the diagnostic test in this case is a stimulation test (conversely, in
endocrine excess states, the diagnostic test is often a suppression test). The ACTH
stimulation test is used to confirm adrenal insufficiency. Synthetic ACTH (cosyn-
tropin) 250 µg is administered intravenously, and serum cortisol levels are measured
at baseline and then at 30- and 60-minute intervals. A maximal stimulated level of
more than 18 µg/dL is considered normal and indicates intact adrenal function.
If cosyntropin stimulation testing indicates probable adrenal insufficiency, ACTH
levels can then be measured to distinguish between primary adrenal insufficiency
(high ACTH) and secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency (low ACTH).
50_Toy-IM_Case49_p507-514.indd 510 03/09/20 9:07 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,538,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 511
The insulin-glucose tolerance test is the gold standard for testing the entire
hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It is based on the principle that if a stressful situation
is induced (in this case, hypoglycemia), the ACTH level should rise with a conse-
quent increase in cortisol levels. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance
imaging are helpful in evaluating adrenal and pituitary disease after biochemical
confirmation.
Treatment
Treatment of Addisonian crisis includes intravenous 5% glucose with normal saline
to correct volume depletion and hypoglycemia and administration of corticosteroid
therapy. Hydrocortisone usually is given intravenously at doses of 100 mg every
6 to 8 hours, or it can be given as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion. At
high doses, the hydrocortisone provides both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
activity. A cortisol level should be drawn before treatment to confirm the diagno-
sis. Causes of the acute crisis should be identified and treated; in particular, there
should be a search for infection.
Long-term treatment of patients with primary adrenal insufficiency includes
replacement doses of glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/d) and miner-
alocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone 0.1–0.2 mg/d). Patients with secondary adrenal
insufficiency still produce aldosterone, as mentioned previously, so only glucocor-
ticoids must be replaced. In both cases, to prevent the long-term complications
of glucocorticoid excess (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, cataracts),
patients should not be overtreated. Stress doses of steroids should be given for
intercurrent illnesses. Patients should wear a medical alert bracelet.
Stress Dose Steroids. When a patient has adrenal insufficiency or adrenal sup-
pression due to chronic supraphysiologic corticosteroid use (equivalent of pred-
nisone 15 mg/d for 3 weeks or longer during the prior 12 months), then stress
dose steroids are needed for events such as surgery or acute illness. Hydrocortisone
100 mg IV every 6 to 8 hours is the standard dose.
Thyroid Hormone and Adrenal Insufficiency. Many patients with adrenal insuf-
ficiency also have hypothyroidism. As the administration of thyroid hormone
treatment increases the overall metabolic rate, the rate of urinary cortisol secretion
is increased. This can exacerbate existing adrenal insufficiency. It is ideal to begin
steroid therapy first, then add thyroid hormone replacement. The situation may be
challenging, as adrenal insufficiency is a much less common disease than hypothy-
roidism, and its development can occur over a period of several years.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
49.1 A 40-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis presents to the postop unit
after an irrigation and debridement of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA)–positive septic joint. His blood pressure is 84/60 mm Hg,
rectal temperature is 101.5 °F, and his heart rate is 95 bpm. Total blood loss
from the surgery was 500 mL. The anesthesia staff give him a bolus 2 L of
normal saline with dopamine and norepinephrine for pressors. His blood
pressure elevates to 89/61 mm Hg. You are called to the postop unit to assess
the situation. Which of the following is the best decision?
A. Start broad vancomycin to combat MRSA infection from septic joint.
B. Administer 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to blood loss.
C. Bolus hydrocortisone due to possible steroid dependence.
D. Order a cosyntropin stimulation test to assess for adrenal insufficiency.
49.2 A 30-year-old woman takes oral prednisone 15 mg/d for systemic lupus ery-
thematosus, which is largely in remission. She is admitted to the hospital for
a cholecystectomy. Which of the following is the most important intervention
for her?
A. Hydrocortisone intravenously before surgery and every 6 hours for
24 hours
B. Double the prednisone the night before and hold her steroids the day of
the surgery
C. Use of cyclophosphamide in lieu of corticosteroids for 2 weeks following
surgery to promote wound healing
D. Cancel the surgery and use lithotripsy to break up the stones
49.3 A 30-year-old woman who is 12 weeks’ postpartum is noted to have adrenal
insufficiency and a very distinct tan, although she hardly ventures outside.
Which of the following is the most likely etiology?
A. Long-term steroid use
B. Sheehan syndrome (pituitary insufficiency)
C. Brain tumor
D. Autoimmune adrenal destruction
ANSWERS
49.1 C. This patient is experiencing adrenal insufficiency in the setting of chronic
steroid dependence. His history of rheumatoid arthritis points to this depen-
dence, and his steroids may have been prematurely discontinued. Septic
shock (answer A) should react to the bolus and pressor therapy. Half a liter
of blood loss (answer B) is not sufficient to cause this profound hypotension.
Additionally, the emergent situation makes the cosyntropin test (answer D)
inadequate.
50_Toy-IM_Case49_p507-514.indd 512 03/09/20 9:07 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,540,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 513
49.2 A. A stress dose of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone) is important to prevent
adrenal insufficiency before surgery, which is a physiologically stressful event.
Doubling the prednisone the night before and holding the steroids on the day
of surgery (answer B) would not supply the sufficient stress dose of steroids
needed. Using cyclophosphamide instead of steroids (answer C) would likely
lead to a flare-up of the lupus; also, corticosteroids need to be discontinued
at least 1 to 2 months prior to surgery so that wound healing is not affected.
Lithotripsy (answer D) would also likely require stress dose steroids and can
lead to sepsis; this modality has limited utility, and patients need to be care-
fully selected (eg, patients with small stones).
49.3 D. Hyperpigmentation occurs as a result of increased melanocyte-stimulating
factor, a byproduct of ACTH, and occurs in primary adrenal insufficiency.
Secondary causes of adrenal insufficiency such as Sheehan syndrome
(answer B) result in low ACTH levels and do not cause the “tanned” appear-
ance. A brain tumor (answer C), such as an ACTH-producing pituitary ade-
noma, would cause overactivation of the adrenal glands, resulting in a
Cushingoid appearance and hyperpigmentation due to the excess ACTH.
There is no history of long-term steroid use (answer A) or the discussion of a
disease process for which long-term steroid use would be indicated.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Primary adrenal insufficiency presents with weakness, fatigue, abdomi-
»
nal pain with vomiting, hyperpigmentation, and hyponatremia with
hypotension refractory to pressors.

A 63-year-old woman is brought to the emergency center for upper arm pain and
swelling following a fall at home. The family has noted that for approximately the
past 2 months, the patient has become progressively fatigued and absentminded,
and she has developed loss of appetite and weight loss. She has been getting
up to urinate several times per night and complains of thirst; a glucose test for
diabetes mellitus in her doctor’s office was negative. This morning, she lost her
balance because she felt “light-headed” and fell, landing on her left arm. Physical
examination is notable for an older, thin woman in mild distress as a result of
pain. She is afebrile, and her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and heart rate is
80 beats per minute (bpm). Her thyroid gland is normal to palpation. Her mucous
membranes are dry and sticky. Heart and lung examinations are normal, and
carotid auscultation reveals no bruits. Examination of her extremities is significant
only for deformity of the left midhumerus with swelling. The left radial pulse is
2+ and symmetric. The radiologist calls you to confirm the fracture of the midleft
humerus but also states that there is suspicion for some lytic lesions of the
proximal humerus and recommends a skull film (Figure 50–1). Serum creatinine
level is 2.1 mg/dL, with normal electrolyte and glucose concentrations, but serum
calcium level is 13 mg/dL, and hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 50:
Hypercalcemia/Multiple Myeloma
Summary: A 63-year-old woman presents with
A humeral fracture sustained during a fall because of light-headedness

A 2-month history of fatigue, absentmindedness, loss of appetite and weight, and

nocturia
Normal vital signs, but appearance of dehydration

Lytic lesions of the skull, proximal humerus, renal insufficiency, anemia, and

hypercalcemia
Most likely diagnosis: Hypercalcemia with pathologic fracture of the left humerus.
Most likely underlying etiology: Multiple myeloma.
Next therapeutic step: Initial therapy of the hypercalcemia with intravenous (IV)
fluids could be started in the emergency department.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia.
(EPA 1, 2)
2. Outline the treatment of symptomatic hypercalcemia. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
The patient presents with acute confusion, fatigue, and lethargy, all symptoms of
hypercalcemia, consistent with the calcium level of 13 mg/dL. The first step in
therapy should be IV saline to restore volume status and facilitate urinary calcium
excretion. Given the rapidity of onset of symptoms, weight loss, age, and presence
of lytic bone lesions, the first concern should be for malignancy, such as multiple
myeloma or bony metastases from an undiagnosed cancer. Both serum and urine
electrophoresis would help to identify the presence of a monoclonal gammopa-
thy. Low serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and absent PTH-related protein
(PTHrP) levels would exclude other causes of hypercalcemia.
APPROACH TO:
Hypercalcemia and Multiple Myeloma
DEFINITIONS
CORRECTED CALCIUM LEVEL: Add 0.8 mg/dL to the serum total calcium for
every 1 g/dL of albumin level below 4 g/dL. Example: If the serum calcium level is
9 mg/dL and the albumin level is 2 g/dL, the corrected calcium level is 10.6 mg/dL.

concentration (normal range approximately 8.8-10.4 mg/dL).
CLINICAL APPROACH TO HYPERCALCEMIA
Pathophysiology
The most common causes of hypercalcemia include malignancies or hyperparathy-
roidism, accounting for 90% of cases. Other causes include granulomatous disor-
ders such as sarcoidosis and tuberculosis; less commonly, hypercalcemia may be
the presentation of intoxication with vitamin A, vitamin D, or calcium-containing
antacids or may occur as a side effect of drugs such as lithium or thiazide diuretics.
Genetic conditions such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and hyperpara-
thyroidism as part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome are less common
causes. Causes of hypercalcemia are listed in Table 50–1.
The differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on the chronicity of the
patient’s presentation and the presence or absence of other symptoms and signs
(Figure 50–2). Primary hyperparathyroidism, usually caused by a solitary parathy-
roid adenoma, is the most likely cause when hypercalcemia is discovered in an oth-
erwise asymptomatic patient on routine laboratory screening.
However, a patient presenting with acute onset of symptomatic hypercalcemia
is more likely to have a malignancy. Multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia
all can present with hypercalcemia, as can solid tumors such as breast, lung, and
kidney cancers. Some of these cancers cause elevated calcium levels by stimulating
osteoclast activity through direct bone marrow invasion (multiple myeloma,
leukemia, and breast cancer). Others produce excess 1,25-vitamin D (lymphomas),
and still others secrete a PTHrP that binds the PTH receptor (kidney and lung).
Cancer-related hypercalcemia can be differentiated from primary hyperparathy-
roidism by finding a suppressed PTH level.
Clinical Presentation
Most patients have no symptoms with mild hypercalcemia (less than 12 mg/dL),
except perhaps some polyuria and dehydration. When calcium exceeds 13 mg/dL,
patients begin developing increasingly severe symptoms, including central nervous
system symptoms (lethargy, stupor, coma, mental status changes, psychosis),
gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, constipation, peptic ulcer disease),
kidney problems (polyuria, nephrolithiasis, prerenal azotemia), and musculoskeletal
complaints (arthralgias, myalgias, weakness).
The symptoms of hyperparathyroidism can be remembered as stones (kidney),
moans (abdominal pain), groans (myalgias), bones (bone pain), and psychiatric
overtones (mental status changes). Diagnosis can be established by finding hyper-
calcemia, hypophosphatemia, and inappropriately elevated PTH levels. Patients
with primary hyperparathyroidism are generally treated surgically with parathy-
roidectomy if any of the following conditions are met: the patient is symptomatic,
the calcium is greater than 1 mg/dL above upper limit of normal, the patient is
less than 50 years old, or if there is significantly decreased bone mineral density
(T score < –2.5). Patients younger than 50 tend to have a lower morbidity and
mortality risk.

Laboratory Tests and Imaging. In this case scenario, checking electrolytes to

mal complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral smear would make leukemia

CLINICAL APPROACH TO MULTIPLE MYELOMA
Pathophysiology
Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells that usually produce
monoclonal immunoglobulins. Patients typically present with lytic bone lesions,
hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and an elevated globulin fraction on
serum chemistries, which, if separated by electrophoresis and identified by immu-
nofixation, shows a monoclonal proliferation (M-spike). The diagnosis of multiple
myeloma requires laboratory and clinical criteria: a monoclonal antibody spike in
the serum, or light chains in the urine; more than 10% clonal plasma cells in the
bone marrow; and end-organ damage such as lytic bone lesions.
Patients with lower level monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) A or IgG antibody
production without the signs or symptoms of multiple myeloma have what is
termed a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is
much more common than myeloma, affecting up to 1% of the population older
than 50 years or up to 10% of people older than age 75. Long-term studies demon-
strated that approximately 1% per year of these patients with MGUS will progress
to develop multiple myeloma.
Treatment
Patients with MGUS typically require no therapy. Some patients with myeloma
with no bone lesions or other end-organ damage have an indolent course (“smoldering
myeloma”) and can be observed without treatment for many years if asymptomatic.
Therapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma includes evaluation for autologous stem
cell transplant and induction chemotherapy with high-dose pulsed dexamethasone,
in combination with thalidomide or lenalidomide, and bortezomib.

following therapies is useful for immediate treatment of the hypercalcemia?
A. Bisphosphonates
B. Erythropoietin
C. Dexamethasone plus thalidomide
D. Interferon-alpha
E. Observe without treatment since she is asymptomatic
50.3 A 22-year-old woman presents with a worsening cough over 6 weeks that
did not improve with a course of antibiotics or antitussives. Her serum cal-
cium level is found to be 12.5 mg/dL, and a chest x-ray reveals bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy. She has erythema nodosum on her legs. Which of the fol-
lowing is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sarcoidosis
B. Mycoplasma pneumonia
C. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
D. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
E. Pulmonary embolism
50.4 A 66-year-old man with known metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the
esophagus is brought to the emergency department for increasing lethargy
and confusion. He is clinically dehydrated, his serum calcium level is 14 mg/dL,
and his creatinine level is 2.5 mg/dL, though 1 month ago it was 0.9 mg/dL.
Which therapy for his hypercalcemia should be instituted first?
A. Intravenous bisphosphonate
B. Intravenous furosemide
C. Glucocorticoids
D. Intravenous normal saline
E. Chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma
ANSWERS
50.1 B. This patient has an elevated serum calcium level and low phosphate level,
which are likely due to an elevated parathyroid level. An asymptomatic and
likely chronically elevated calcium level is most likely caused by primary
hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. The hypercalcemia is
presumed to be chronic because she has osteoporosis and is premenopausal.

Case Files Internal Medicine,550,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 523
Multiple myeloma (answer A) usually leads to elevated calcium and phos-
phate levels and lytic lesions of the bones. Familial hypocalciuric hypercal-
cemia (answer C) can also lead to elevated serum calcium and low serum
phosphate levels, but it is usually asymptomatic and is far rarer than primary
hyperparathyroidism. Sarcoidosis (answer D) is a granulomatous disease that
is associated with an elevated calcitriol production leading to increased serum
calcium and phosphate as well as increased 1,25(OH) vitamin D; osteopo-
2
rosis is not seen. Undiagnosed breast cancer (answer E) with metastases to
the bones can lead to elevated serum calcium and phosphate levels; this is less
likely.
50.2 A. Bisphosphonates are helpful in controlling hypercalcemia through inhibi-
tion of osteoclastic bone reabsorption. Dexamethasone, in combination with
thalidomide (answer C), is useful in treatment of the myeloma, with a slower
effect on the calcium level. Erythropoietin (answer B) is inappropriate and is
used to increase synthesis of red blood cells in those with renal failure.
Interferon-alpha (answer D) is also not a treatment for hypercalcemia but is
used for some cancers such as kidney, melanoma, carcinoid, and some lympho-
mas. Though the patient has no symptoms, observing alone (answer E) is not
appropriate in presence of hypercalcemia.
50.3 A. Both sarcoidosis and lymphoma can present with cough, dyspnea, and
hilar adenopathy on chest x-ray. In approximately 10% of cases, sarcoidosis
can cause elevated calcium levels through the production of 1,25-vitamin D
that occurs in the macrophages of the granulomas. This can also be seen in
granulomas caused by tuberculosis and in lymphoma. Leukemia (answer C)
usually does not present in this manner, although it can cause hypercalcemia.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (answer D) would be unusual in a patient
of this age, and the radiographic presentation is atypical. The case scenario
is consistent with Lofgren syndrome, an acute presentation of sarcoidosis,
which includes hilar adenopathy, erythema nodosum, migratory polyarthral-
gia, and fever, seen most often in women. Neither pneumonia (answer B) nor
pulmonary embolism (answer E) is associated with hypercalcemia.
50.4 D. Although all of the other therapies listed may be helpful in the treatment
of hypercalcemia, given the clinical findings of dehydration and elevated
creatinine level with a history of previously normal renal function, volume
expansion with normal saline would correct the dehydration and presumed
prerenal azotemia, allowing the kidneys to more efficiently excrete calcium.
Other therapies (answers A, B, C, E) can be added if the response to normal
saline alone is insufficient.

ANSWERS TO CASE 51:
Type 2 Diabetes Diagnosis and Management
Summary: A 52-year-old woman presents for her yearly physical examination with
Medical history notable only for borderline hypertension and moderate obesity

Family history of diabetes and hypertension

Poor adherence to the recommended lifestyle changes

Blood pressure of 140/92 mm Hg and BMI of 29 kg/m2


Most likely diagnosis: Given her obesity, family history, and the finding of acan-
thosis nigricans, this patient most likely has type 2 diabetes. Diagnostic criteria
for diabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) include
(1) hemoglobin A greater than 6.5%, (2) fasting plasma glucose of 126 mg/dL
1C
or greater, (3) 2-hour plasma glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater during oral glu-
cose tolerance test, or (4) a random plasma glucose of 200 mg/dL in the setting of
hyperglycemic symptoms.
Next step: Dietary counseling, assess for end-organ disease, and check hemoglobin
A (Hb A ).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes. (EPA 3)
2. Describe the initial medical management of diabetes. (EPA 4)
3. Understand cardiovascular risk modification in diabetic patients. (EPA 4, 12)
4. Understand the prevention of microvascular complications of diabetes.
(EPA 12)
Considerations
This patient has a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus unless there was a laboratory error
(patient not truly fasting). If this patient’s diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed, she
will require patient education, lifestyle modification, and medical therapy to pre-
vent acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Strict glycemic control can reduce
the incidence of microvascular complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy.
In addition, patients with diabetes are among the highest at risk for cardiovas-
cular disease, so risk factor modifications, such as smoking cessation and lower-
ing of cholesterol, are essential. Diabetes confers the same level of risk for coronary
events, such as heart attack, as in patients with established coronary artery disease
and no prior diabetes. In patients with diabetes, the target blood pressure is gener-
ally less than 130/80 mm Hg, and the percentage of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
52_Toy-IM_Case51_p525-534.indd 526 24/08/20 3:48 PM"

cholesterol lowering should be based on the calculated atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease risk.
APPROACH TO:
Diabetes Mellitus
DEFINITIONS
TYPE 1 DIABETES: Autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells and
complete loss of endogenous insulin production. The presentation of this type of
diabetes usually is acute, with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. These patients
are dependent on exogenous insulin delivery.
TYPE 2 DIABETES: Heterogeneous syndrome consisting of insulin resistance,
progressively decreased insulin secretion, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and
multiple other defects; it is exacerbated by genetic factors, obesity, and/or lack
of physical activity. Oral medications and injectable incretin mimetic drugs that
address specific defects of type 2 diabetes are useful. Exogenous insulin may be
used when oral drugs and incretin mimetic medications are no longer sufficient for
adequate glycemic control.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
As the prevalence of obesity increases in the American population, so does the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Ninety percent of all new cases of diabetes diagnosed
in the United States are type 2, and it is estimated that this disease affects approxi-
mately 30.3 million people in the United States. Diabetes is the leading cause of
blindness, renal failure, and nontraumatic amputations of the lower extremities. It
is a major risk factor in patients with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, and stroke.
In contrast to type 1 diabetics, patients with type 2 diabetes usually have a pro-
longed asymptomatic phase. During these years of asymptomatic hyperglycemia,
however, organ damage begins to occur.
Screening. The ADA recommends screening overweight and obese adults with
one of the following risk factors: hypertension, HDL level below 35 mg/dL, hyper-
triglyceridemia above 250 mg/dL, first-degree relative with diabetes, being a mem-
ber of a high-risk ethnic/race group (ie, African Americans, Hispanics, American
Indians, Asian Americans, or Pacific Islanders), prediabetes, physical inactivity, his-
tory of gestational diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, history of polycystic
ovarian syndrome, or other insulin-resistant condition (eg, acanthosis nigricans,
severe obesity).
Repeat screening should be done at least yearly for prediabetes and at least every
3 years for a history of gestational diabetes. For all other adult patients, the ADA rec-
ommends screening start at age 45 with a minimum of 3-year intervals between tests.
52_Toy-IM_Case51_p525-534.indd 527 24/08/20 3:48 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,555,"528 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Older children and adolescents who are overweight/obese and exhibit an afore-
mentioned risk factor should also be screened.
Pathophysiology
Most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are insulin resistant and hyperinsulin-
emic for years before developing overt diabetes. They are able to maintain normo-
glycemia for a long time, then develop postprandial hyperglycemia and later both
postprandial and fasting hyperglycemia (eg, hyperglycemia all the time). Thus, a
glucose tolerance test to detect postprandial hyperglycemia would be the most sen-
sitive test for diabetes mellitus, but it is time consuming and difficult to perform in
a clinical practice. The fasting plasma glucose is a more specific test. Hemoglobin A
1C
> 6.5% has now also been recognized as an acceptable diagnostic criterion (Table
51–1). In the setting of hyperglycemia symptoms, a random plasma glucose above
200 mg/dL is enough for diagnosis. If there are no clear symptoms of hyperglyce-
mia, the diagnosis of diabetes should be confirmed on a subsequent day by repeat
measurement, repeating the same test for confirmation. However, if two different
tests (eg, fasting glucose and A ) are available and are concordant for the diagnosis
1C
of diabetes, additional testing is not needed.
By using these tests, patients can be classified into one of three categories:
(1) normal, (2) impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose (eg,
“prediabetic”), or (3) diabetic. Increased risk for microvascular complications of
hyperglycemia is seen at a fasting glucose more than 126 mg/dL or Hb A > 6.5%.
1C
Once diabetes is diagnosed, therapy is instituted with three major goals, which are
listed below.
1. Prevention of acute complications of hyperglycemia (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis
[DKA] or nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia) or hypoglycemia
2. Prevention of long-term complications of hyperglycemia, for example, micro-
vascular disease such as retinopathy or nephropathy
3. Prevention of long-term complications of macrovascular disease, for example,
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease
Treatment
The foundation of diabetes therapy is dietary and lifestyle modifications. Exer-
cise and even small amounts of weight loss can lower blood pressure and improve

glucose control. Patients should be given instruction in nutrition and encouraged
to change sedentary lifestyles.
However, most people with diabetes will eventually require medical therapy, and
many patients will eventually require a combination of at least two medications.
Because of the difficulty in achieving and sustaining glycemic targets and achieving
significant weight loss, the ADA recommends that metformin should be initiated
concurrently with lifestyle intervention at the time of diagnosis.
The glycemic goal is individualized based on multiple factors (eg, hypoglycemia risk,
life expectancy, other disease comorbidities) but is generally a hemoglobin A < 7%.
1C
If patients fail to achieve the glycemic goal with initial therapy, including lifestyle
modification and metformin, therapeutic options include adding a second oral or
injectable agent, including insulin, or switching to insulin monotherapy. A list of
therapeutic agents for diabetes is included in Table 51–2.

When diabetes is diagnosed, other cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed.
Blood pressure and lipid levels should be measured. The cardiovascular risk in those
with diabetes is equivalent to those with known coronary artery disease. Statins
are the preferred LDL reduction medication, with goal reduction depending on the
intensity of the regimen. Moderate-dose statins should aim to reduce LDL by 30%
to 50%, while high-intensity statins should aim for 50% reduction or more.
The desired blood pressure goal in an individual with diabetes and hypertension is
< 140/90 mm Hg if the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk is less than 15%;
otherwise, one should pursue a lower target of < 130/80 mm Hg if it can be safely
attained. Several randomized trials have demonstrated a benefit for angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in preventing
the progression of proteinuria and kidney disease.
Other routine care in diabetic patients includes frequent primary care provider
visits, at least every 3 to 6 months depending on the patient’s glucose control, at
least yearly ophthalmologic examinations to screen for retinopathy, yearly urine
screens to detect microalbuminuria, and yearly foot examinations to detect periph-
eral neuropathy (if patient has no prior neuropathy). Hemoglobin A should be
1C
checked at least every 3 to 6 months, depending on the patient’s glucose control.
This test allows the clinician to know the general glucose control over the preced-
ing 2 to 3 months.
Patients with established neuropathy should be examined at every visit and be
instructed on daily self-examination and prevention of injury. In fact, neuropathy is
the main risk factor for the development of a foot ulcer and subsequent develop-
ment of a wound; this can progress into a nonhealing ulcer that sometimes requires
surgical amputation. Thus, careful foot care and daily examination are the most
important preventive steps.

51.2 A 45-year-old obese woman presents for follow-up for her diabetes. She
currently takes metformin 1000 mg twice per day, and her fasting morn-
ing glucose runs approximately 170 to 200 mg/dL. Her last serum Hb A
1C
level was 7.9%. She states that she conscientiously follows her diet and
walks 30 minutes to 1 hour daily. Which of the following is the best next
step in her care?
A. Refer to an endocrinologist for an insulin pump.

D. Hospitalize her urgently.
51.3 A 75-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes for approximately 20 years, dia-
betic retinopathy, and diabetic nephropathy is brought into the clinic by
her daughter for follow-up. The patient’s last serum creatinine level was
2.2 mg/dL. The patient currently takes a glyburide for her diabetes and lisin-
opril for her proteinuria. Her daughter reports that on three occasions in the
past 2 weeks, her mother became sweaty, shaky, and confused, which resolved
when she was given some orange juice. Which of the following conditions is
most likely to be contributing to these episodes?
A. Excess caloric oral intake
B. Interaction between the ACE inhibitor and the sulfonylurea agents

ANSWERS
51.1 B. By diagnostic criteria, this patient falls into the definition of impaired fast-
ing glucose, which is between 100 and 125 mg/dL. A normal fasting glucose
level is < 100 mg/dL; diabetes can be diagnosed by a fasting glucose level of
126 mg/dL or higher. Although she does not yet meet the criteria for diabetes
(answer C), she is at greater risk for developing diabetes in the future and
for macrovascular disease. Intensive lifestyle changes (diet and exercise for
30 minutes per day, 5 days per week) can prevent or delay the development
of diabetes. Patients should be monitored annually to screen for progression
to diabetes. Cardiac stress testing (answer D) is indicated if there is chest
pain or other suspicion of coronary heart disease. This patient does not have
normal blood sugars (answer A) or DKA (answer E).
51.2 C. When patients fail to achieve glycemic goal (Hb A < 7%) using metfor-
1C
min and lifestyle modifications, the next step is to add a second agent (not
discontinue metformin, as in answer B). Among the choices are glucagon-
like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (eg, liraglutide), dipeptidyl pepti-
dase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2
(SGLT-2) inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin), thiazolidinediones (eg, piogli-
tazone), sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide), and once-daily basal insulin injection
(a long-acting insulin such as NPH, glargine, or detemir). If a patient has
known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or
SGLT-2 is preferred. If patient has heart failure or chronic kidney disease,
consider an SGLT-2 inhibitor (answer B). An endocrine consultation and an
insulin pump (answer A) in a type 2 diabetic are mainly needed because of
failure to achieve glycemic control with multiple injections of insulin. Hospi-
talization for an urgent condition (answer D) is indicated if there is suspicion
of a serious complication, such as HHNS.
51.3 C. Sulfonylureas have long half-lives and can cause prolonged hypoglycemia
in elderly patients as well in those with renal insufficiency; glyburide is notori-
ous for this complication. For these reasons, many practitioners will avoid sul-
fonylurea agents (even newer ones) in elderly patients. Another hypoglycemic
agent, such as insulin, may be more appropriate in this patient, as well as less-
intensive control, aiming for an Hb A of 8% instead of 7%. If a sulfonylurea
1C
agent must be used for some reason, then glipizide and glimepiride are the
agents of choice with chronic kidney disease. Excess caloric intake (answer A)
would not lead to hypoglycemia, but rather hyperglycemia. ACE inhibitors
and sulfonylurea agents (answer B) may lead to a temporary sensitization of
the sulfonylurea agent, but this usually resolves after a short time. Hypergly-
cemic amnesia (answer D) presents a cognitive decline due to hyperglycemia;
this patient’s symptoms are much more consistent with hypoglycemia.
51.4 B. The 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test is used as the reference standard
and has the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Even
with this “gold standard,” there are undiagnosed diabetics. Fasting glucose
52_Toy-IM_Case51_p525-534.indd 532 24/08/20 3:48 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,560,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 533
(answer A) is a fairly good test with a sensitivity of about 82% and has
the advantage of reproducibility. Hemoglobin A (answer C) is also an
1C
acceptable test; however, the sensitivity is around 60% in patients with a
hemoglobin A above 6.5%. The hemoglobin A is additionally advanta-
1C 1C
geous because serum levels correlate with long-term outcomes. A random
glucose (answer D) is only about 50% sensitive and is seldom used as a
screening test.
51.5 C. A patient who is diagnosed with diabetes should receive the hepatitis B
vaccine as soon as feasible if not vaccinated previously. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention recommends hepatitis B vaccination for diabet-
ics aged 18 to 59, and consideration for those > 60 years due to the increased
risk of hepatitis B case fatality rate in diabetics. Diabetes confers a 60% higher
infection rate versus nondiabetics. Diabetics should receive an annual influ-
enza vaccination as well as the pneumococcal vaccine after the age of 65 if the
first dose was administered prior to the age of 65. HPV vaccine (answer B) is
recommended for patients between the ages of 11 and 26 years. Rubella vac-
cine (answer D) is routinely recommended in men; however, women in the
childbearing age who are nonimmune should also be vaccinated. Toxoplas-
mosis vaccine (answer A) does not exist. In summary, diabetics should receive
five vaccines: annual influenza vaccine, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, acellular
pertussis) vaccine, zoster vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and the hepatitis B
vaccine.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Type 2 diabetes has a prolonged asymptomatic stage during which
»
microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy) can
occur. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and screen
patients with risk factors.
Lifestyle modification and metformin are the initial therapy for most
»
patients when they are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
The major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type
»
2 diabetes mellitus is macrovascular disease, such as coronary artery
disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, so aggressive cardio-
vascular risk factor reduction is essential.
Glycemic goals are individualized for each patient but generally include
»
Hb A < 7%.
1C
Blood pressure target should be < 140/90 or < 130/80 mm Hg (depend-
»
ing on cardiovascular risk), and LDL cholesterol should be lowered (usu-
ally by 30% to 50%) with a statin, based on the patient’s atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease risk.

An 18-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her mother
because the daughter seems confused and is behaving strangely. The mother
reports the patient has always been healthy and has no significant medical history,
but she has lost 20 lb recently without trying and has been complaining of fatigue
for 2 or 3 weeks. The patient had attributed the fatigue to sleep disturbance, as
recently she has been getting up several times at night to urinate. This morning,
the mother found the patient in her room, complaining of abdominal pain and
vomiting. She appeared confused and did not know that today was a school day.
On examination, the patient is slender and lying on a stretcher with her eyes
closed, but she is responsive to questions. She is afebrile and has a heart rate (HR)
of 118 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 125/84 mm Hg, and deep
and rapid respirations at the rate of 24 breaths per minute. Upon standing, her HR
rises to 145 bpm, and her BP falls to 110/80 mm Hg. Her fundoscopic examination
is normal, her oral mucosa is dry, and her neck veins are flat. Her chest is clear to
auscultation, and her heart is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmur.
Her abdomen is soft with active bowel sounds and mild diffuse tenderness, but no
guarding or rebound. Her neurologic examination reveals no focal deficits.

ANSWERS TO CASE 52:
Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Type 1 Diabetes
Summary: An 18-year-old woman presents with
A few weeks of unintentional weight loss, nocturia, and polyuria

Hyperglycemia that likely represents new-onset diabetes mellitus, probably type 1

Hypovolemia due to osmotic diuresis

An anion gap metabolic acidosis due to an increase in ketoacid production

Acute altered mental status (confusion)

Abdominal pain, vomiting, and labored breathing

Most likely diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Underlying pathophysiology: Absolute insulin deficiency favors glycogenolysis,
gluconeogenesis, and ketosis, resulting in hyperglycemia, osmotic diuresis, and an
anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Known precipitating factors: New-onset diabetes mellitus (typically type 1), inad-
equate insulin treatment or nonadherence, poor socioeconomic status, infection,
pancreatitis, volume depletion, cocaine use, pregnancy, myocardial infarction, or
cerebrovascular accident.
Next step in medical management: Aggressive hydration to improve her volume sta-
tus and insulin therapy to resolve the ketoacidosis.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Differentiate causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis. (EPA 2)
2. Differentiate DKA from nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia and alco-
holic ketoacidosis. (EPA 2, 3)
3. Manage DKA by restoring volume, replacing electrolyte, and treating ketosis
and hyperglycemia. (EPA 4, 10)
4. List the complications of DKA and of improper management. (EPA 12)
Considerations
DKA occurs as a result of severe insulin deficiency and may be the initial pre-
sentation of diabetes mellitus, as in this patient. In all patients with DKA, one
must be alert for precipitating factors, such as infection, pregnancy, or severe
physiologic stressors, such as myocardial infarction. The diagnostic criteria include
arterial pH < 7.3, low serum bicarbonate with an anion gap, glucose > 250 mg/dL,
elevated serum ketones (> 5 mEq/L), and elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate
(> 3 mmol/L). The patient in this scenario has significant DKA based on the pH of
7.11. The bicarbonate of 9 mEq/L and anion gap of 27 mEq/L confirm metabolic

acidosis from accumulation of organic acids. This patient needs immediate fluid
repletion with normal saline (NS) and insulin infusion. Initial testing should
include serum glucose, serum electrolytes, magnesium, phosphorus, amylase and
lipase, urine dipstick, serum ketones, ABG, complete blood count (CBC), BUN
and creatinine, urine and/or blood cultures, and an electrocardiogram (ECG).
APPROACH TO:
Diabetic Ketoacidosis
DEFINITIONS
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS: A syndrome of hyperglycemia, anion gap meta-
bolic acidosis, and ketone bodies in the serum, caused by insufficient insulin levels.
KUSSMAUL RESPIRATIONS: Deep and rapid breathing that represents hyper-
ventilation in an attempt to generate a respiratory alkalosis to compensate for the
metabolic acidosis.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
DKA is a hyperglycemic complication of diabetes mellitus caused by a significant
insulin deficiency and characterized by anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia,
and ketosis. It is a medical emergency, with an overall mortality rate less than 5%
if patients receive prompt and appropriate medical treatment. Most episodes are
preventable, and many deaths are avoidable with proper attention to detail during
management.
Normal Physiology. In the normal physiologic state, there is a fine balance
between anabolic and catabolic hormones. In the fed state, anabolic actions of insu-
lin predominate. Glycogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis all are increased.
This results in storage of energy reserves in the form of triglycerides and glycogen.
In the fasting state, insulin serves to inhibit lipolysis, ketogenesis, gluconeogen-
esis, glycogenolysis, and proteolysis. These effects are critical in controlling the rate
of breakdown of energy stores under the influence of catabolic hormones. Glucagon
is the most important catabolic hormone. In the fasting state, it maintains normal
glucose levels by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Diabetes mellitus is the condition of relative or absolute
insulin deficiency. When there is a severe insulin deficiency and a relative excess
of glucagon, lipolysis is enhanced, causing release of free fatty acids. Oxidation of
the fatty acids produces ketones, such as acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate,
which are organic acids often referred to as ketoacids. The excess of these ketoacids
can produce a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. In addition, hyperglycemia pro-
duces an osmotic diuresis, which causes severe volume depletion and electrolyte
deficiencies by washing extracellular sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate,
53_Toy-IM_Case52_p535-546.indd 537 24/08/20 3:49 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,565,"538 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
and water out of the body. The combination of acidosis, hypovolemia, and electro-
lyte deficiencies can lead to cardiovascular collapse, the most common cause of death
in DKA.
Patients with diabetes have an underlying impairment in glucose metabolism
and, when challenged by a stressor, an increase in insulin requirements. If they are
unable to meet these insulin requirements, DKA may result. It is important to cor-
rect precipitating factors in order to restore metabolic balance. Identifiable sources
of infection should be treated aggressively. Possible presence of ischemia and
infarction should be evaluated and treated appropriately with help from specialists
as needed. The most common precipitating events are infections such as pneumonia
or urinary tract infection, vascular disorders such as myocardial infarction, or other
stressors such as trauma.
DKA may be the presentation of new-onset diabetes; it may also occur in
patients with established diabetes because of failure to use insulin or because
of the use of other medications (eg, glucocorticoids) that interfere with insulin
action.
Clinical Presentation
An episode of DKA evolves over a short period of time, typically in less than
24 hours. The patient with DKA has the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia,
acidosis, and dehydration. Polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, visual blurring, and
alteration in mental status are related to hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis.
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath may
be related to the acidosis.
Typical signs include decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, hypoten-
sion, and tachycardia related to volume depletion. Kussmaul respirations, deep and
rapid breathing, represent hyperventilation in an attempt to generate a respiratory
alkalosis to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. One may also note the fruity
breath odor typical of ketosis.
Laboratory Values. Laboratory values show hyperglycemia (usually > 250 mg/dL),
acidosis (pH < 7.3), anion gap (usually > 15 mmol/L), and ketonemia. The most
important laboratory parameters are the degree of acidosis, the anion gap, and the
serum potassium level. Beta-hydroxybutyrate assay may be obtained in order to
quantify the severity of the ketonemia present. Patients with a very low pH (< 7.0)
are severely acidotic and have a worse prognosis. The lower pH is a result of the
higher concentration of ketoacids, which are estimated using the anion gap.
Anion Gap. The first step in evaluating any patient with metabolic acidosis
should be calculation of the anion gap. This concept is based on the principle of
electrical neutrality, that is, all the cations must equal all the anions. The anion gap
estimates those negatively charged particles that are not routinely measured and
can be calculated using the following calculation:
Anion Gap = [Na] – [Cl + HCO ]
3
The normal anion gap is 10 to 12 mmol/L. When it is elevated, there is an excess
of unmeasured anions, which typically occurs because of one of the four causes
(Table 52–1).

Lactic acidosis results from severe tissue hypoxia, as in septic shock or carbon
monoxide poisoning, or from hepatic failure and subsequent inability to metabolize
lactate. Ketoacidosis most commonly occurs as an acute complication of uncon-
trolled diabetes, but it also can be seen in starvation and alcoholism. The ingested
toxins may be organic acids themselves, such as salicylic acid, or have acidic metab-
olites, such as formic acid from methanol. Renal failure leads to an inability to
excrete organic acids as well as inorganic acids such as phosphates (often without
an anion gap).
In patients with DKA, total body potassium stores are depleted because of uri-
nary losses, and potassium replacement will always be necessary. Initially, the mea-
sured serum potassium levels may be high despite the total body potassium deficit
because of acidosis resulting in movement of potassium from the intracellular to
the extracellular compartment. With the correction of the acidosis and the admin-
istration of insulin, which drives potassium intracellularly, serum potassium levels
will fall rapidly.
The serum sodium level can be variable. Hyperglycemia causes water to move
extracellularly, which can lead to hyponatremia. Similarly, phosphate levels can be
variable in the presence of body store deficits, with the extracellular movement of
phosphate caused by catabolic state. BUN and creatinine levels are elevated, reflect-
ing hypovolemia. Serum acetoacetate may cause a false elevation in the serum cre-
atinine level because of interference with the assay.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is restoration of metabolic homeostasis with correction of
precipitating events and biochemical deficits, which consists of the following:
1. Replacement of fluid losses with improvement of circulatory volume
2. Correction of hyperglycemia and, in turn, plasma osmolality
3. Replacement of electrolyte losses
4. Clearance of serum ketones
5. Identification and treatment of precipitating cause and complications
53_Toy-IM_Case52_p535-546.indd 539 24/08/20 3:49 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,567,"540 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Close monitoring of the patient is important. A flow sheet recording vital signs,
fluid input and output, insulin dosage, and metabolic progress is important. Serum
glucose concentration should be measured every 1 hour, and levels of serum elec-
trolytes and phosphate must be assessed every 3 to 5 hours. Common ketone
assays, blood, urine, and/or sputum cultures should be obtained if urine analysis
or chest radiography indicates infection. Electrocardiography (ECG) should be
checked to look for evidence of a cardiovascular event or arrhythmias due to meta-
bolic derangement. Other investigations should be pursued as symptoms and signs
warrant.
Fluids. All patients with DKA are volume depleted as a consequence of
osmotic diuresis as well as from other ongoing losses, such as vomiting. Hydra-
tion improves renal perfusion and cardiac output, facilitating glucose excretion.
Rehydration may also diminish insulin resistance by decreasing levels of counter-
regulatory hormones and hyperglycemia. Sudden reduction in hyperglycemia can
lead to vascular collapse with a shift of water intracellularly. To avoid this, initial
replacement fluid should be isotonic NS to correct circulatory volume deficit.
Over the first hour, 1 to 2 L of NS should be infused. Following this, total body
water deficit is corrected at the rate of 250 to 500 mL/h, depending on the state
of hydration. The composition of fluid should be tailored according to serum
sodium and chloride measurements. Hydration should be gentler in patients
with heart failure or end-stage renal disease because such patients can easily be
affected by fluid overload.
Insulin. The goal of therapy is a glucose reduction of 80 to 100 mg/dL/h. Use
of continuous low-dose intravenous infusion of insulin is recommended because it
reduces episodes of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, and it allows for a more con-
trolled reduction of serum glucose and osmolality. Intramuscular and subcutane-
ous routes can be used if tissue perfusion is adequate.
Insulin treatment may be initiated as an intravenous bolus of 0.1 to 0.15 U/kg.
This should be followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 U/kg/h with hourly serum
glucose determinations. If blood glucose fails to decline at the desired rate, volume
status should be reassessed, and the insulin infusion should be titrated accordingly.
The rate of infusion should be decreased to 0.05 U/kg/h when the blood glucose
level decreases to 250 to 300 mg/dL (if the acidosis is corrected). Glucose levels fall
more quickly than ketosis resolves. Insulin is necessary for resolution of the keto-
acidosis and can be coadministered with a glucose infusion until the anion gap is
resolved. A 5% to 10% dextrose solution should be added to the hydrating solution
when plasma glucose is less than 300 mg/dL.
One can judge the resolution of ketoacidosis when the bicarbonate is more than
18 mEq/L, the anion gap is less than 12, the patient feels better, and the vital signs
are stabilized. Serial determination of serum ketone levels is not clinically useful in
measuring response to therapy. Common ketone assays utilize nitroprusside, mea-
suring acetoacetate and acetone, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate. Administration of
insulin will induce oxidation of beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, resulting in
an increase in ketone levels despite effective therapy. When available, beta-hydroxy-
butyrate assay can be helpful, as a level greater than 3 mmol/L is shown to be highly
sensitive and specific for DKA.
53_Toy-IM_Case52_p535-546.indd 540 24/08/20 3:49 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,568,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 541
In the event serum ketone measurements are not available, one should be guided
by normalizing the anion gap when making decisions about the rate of insulin infu-
sion. Subcutaneous insulin should be given approximately 30 minutes before stop-
ping insulin infusion to avoid rebound acidosis.
Bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy is controversial and should not be given to
ketoacidotic patients unless their arterial pH is less than 7.00 or other indications,
such as cardiac instability or severe hyperkalemia, are present. Bicarbonate therapy
can cause worsening hypokalemia, paradoxical central nervous system acidosis, and
delay in ketone clearance.
Electrolytes. In DKA, there is a deficit of total body potassium, phosphate, and
magnesium. Patients frequently have hyperkalemia as a result of acidosis, insulin
deficiency, and hypertonicity that cause a shift of potassium extracellularly. During
treatment, the plasma potassium concentration will fall as the metabolic abnor-
malities are corrected. Potassium should be added to initial intravenous fluids once
the concentration is less than 5 mEq/L. Once adequate urine output is established,
20 to 40 mEq of potassium should be added to each liter of fluid. The goal is to
maintain potassium in the range of 4 to 5 mEq/L. Cardiac monitoring is recom-
mended in the presence of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia.
Other Electrolytes. Phosphate replacement should be given to patients with
serum phosphate concentrations less than 1 mg/dL and to patients with moderate
hypophosphatemia with concomitant hypoxia, anemia, or cardiorespiratory com-
promise. Careful monitoring of the serum calcium level is necessary with phos-
phate administration. Magnesium and calcium can be supplemented as needed.
Prevention. The major precipitating factors in the development of DKA are
inadequate insulin treatment and infection. These events can be prevented by
patient education and effective communication with a health care team. Sick-day
management regarding dosing of insulin, blood glucose monitoring, avoiding pro-
longed fasting, and preventing dehydration should be addressed. Socioeconomic
barriers contribute to the high rates of admission for DKA. Appropriate allocation
of health care resources toward preventive strategies is needed.
Complications
Cerebral edema secondary to hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis, acute respiratory
distress syndrome, thromboembolism secondary to coagulation cascade and fibri-
nolysis derangement, fluid overload, and acute gastric dilation are rare, but serious,
complications of DKA.
Other metabolic complications of deranged carbohydrate metabolism deserve
mention at this point. The first is hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma. This con-
dition occurs mainly in patients with type 2 diabetes who become profoundly dehy-
drated because of osmotic diuresis. However, these patients have sufficient insulin
action to prevent the development of ketoacidosis. They may present with glucose
levels more than 1000 mg/dL, serum osmolarity more than 320 to 370 Osm/L,
and neurologic symptoms ranging from confusion to seizures to coma. Compared
to patients with DKA, they have a much larger fluid deficit, and therapy is primar-
ily volume resuscitation with NS. Insulin is also used to reverse hyperglycemia but
usually is given in lesser doses than is required for clearance of ketosis in DKA.

Case Files Internal Medicine,569,"542 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Alcoholic ketoacidosis develops in chronic alcoholics who are malnourished and
have depleted glycogen stores. It is often seen in the setting of binge drinking, which
may shift the ratio of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), inhibiting gluconeogene-
sis. These patients develop an anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of ketoacido-
sis and lactic acidosis. They present with the same symptoms of acidosis as do
DKA patients, for example, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but with low,
normal, or slightly elevated glucose levels (in contrast to DKA, in which the glucose
level usually is markedly elevated). Treatment is administration of volume in the
form of NS and glucose solution. Insulin administration is typically unnecessary.
Thiamine may need to be coadministered.

52.2 An 18-year-old man is being seen the emergency center for nausea, vom-
iting, lightheadedness, and fatigue. He is a known type 1 diabetic and
states that he has been taking his insulin as scheduled. On examination,
his BP is 80/40 mm Hg, temperature is 101 °F, HR is 120 bpm, and RR
is 30 breaths/min. He has some adenopathy of the cervical area. Laboratory test
values show an arterial pH of 7.20, po of 100 mm Hg, pco of 28 mm Hg, and
2 2
HCO of 12 mEq/L. His serum glucose level is 400 mg/dL. Which of the
3
following is the most accurate statement regarding this patient’s likely potas-
sium status?
A. Likely to have a serum potassium level less than 3 mEq/L.
B. Likely to have a serum potassium level more than 7 mEq/L.
C. Likely to have a total body potassium deficit regardless of the serum level.
D. Serum level is likely to increase with correction of the acidosis.
52.3 An 11-year-old girl is being seen in the pediatric emergency department for
near syncope. She is being followed for type 1 diabetes and is not very adherent
to her medications or diet. Her current BP is 90/60 mm Hg, HR is 120 bpm,
RR is 26 breaths/min, and temperature is afebrile. Based on an arterial
blood gas with a pH of 7.23 and a serum glucose level of 550 mg/dL, she
is diagnosed with DKA. Which of the following is the most important first
step in the treatment of this patient?
A. Replacement of potassium
B. Intravenous fluid replacement
C. Replacement of phosphorus
D. Antibiotic therapy
52.4 A 59-year-old man with a long history of diabetes with chronic renal insuf-
ficiency due to diabetic nephropathy is seen in clinic for routine laboratory
work. He is asymptomatic, but his glucose is elevated at 258 mg/dL. His
other chemistries are as follows: sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 5.4 mEq/L,
chloride 108 mEq/L, and bicarbonate 18 mEq/L. His creatinine is stable at
2.1 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s
acidemia?
A. Diabetic ketoacidosis
B. Lactic acidosis
C. Type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA)
D. Accidental salicylate overdose
ANSWERS
52.1 A. This patient has a metabolic acidosis based on the low pH and the low
pco (partial respiratory compensation). The anion gap is calculated by
2
the following formula: Anion Gap = [Na+] – [Cl–+ HCO ]. In this case,
3
the patient’s anion gap = 138 – (105 + 23) = 10, which is normal (recall
53_Toy-IM_Case52_p535-546.indd 543 24/08/20 3:49 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,571,"544 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
normal anion gap is 10-12). Diarrhea leads to bicarbonate loss and usually
does not affect the anion gap. All other choices (answer B, lactic acidosis;
answer C, DKA; and answer D, ethylene glycol ingestion) are causes of a high
anion gap metabolic acidosis. Common causes can be remembered with
the MUDPILES mnemonic (methanol, uremia, DKA, propylene glycol,
iron/isoniazid/infection, lactic acidosis, ethylene glycol, salicylates).
52.2 C. Total body potassium usually is depleted regardless of the serum level due
to urinary loss; an extracellular shift of potassium in the setting of acido-
sis may explain high serum potassium levels (answer B) upon diagnosis of
DKA. Answer A (serum potassium < 3 mEq/L) would be unusual in light
of the acidosis; the typical level would be normal. Answer D (serum potassium
> 7 mEq/L) would be highly unusual, since this level of elevation would often
lead to cardiac arrhythmias and possibly death; a mildly elevated or normal
serum potassium level would be more commonly encountered.
52.3 B. The basic tenets of treating DKA include intravenous fluid, insulin to con-
trol the glucose level, correction of metabolic disturbances (eg, repletion of
potassium), and identification of the underlying etiology. Intravenous fluids
to support the circulatory status (BP) are the most important first step in
this patient. Lowering the blood sugar would be the next important step.
Correction of metabolic abnormalities such as of potassium (answer A) and
phosphorus (answer C) are next considered, although the potassium level is
more dangerous and a higher priority. Answer D (antibiotics) should be given
if a patient is thought to have an infection leading to the DKA; in this patient,
there is no fever or symptom suggestive of infection. Even with the presence
of infection, intravenous fluids would be the first priority.
52.4 C. The patient likely has type 4 RTA. RTA leads to electrolyte abnormalities
due to abnormal renal tubular transport.
Type 1 = impaired renal hydrogen ion excretion in the distal tubule

Type 2 = impaired bicarbonate resorption in the proximal tubule

Type 4 = abnormal aldosterone production or response (usually hyperka-

lemia and non–anion gap acidosis)
NOTE: Type 3 RTA is combined proximal and distal tubule and very rare.
The laboratories are consistent with a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis. The
anion gap = 135 – (108 + 18) = 9 (normal is 10-12). Patients with chronic
kidney disease due to diabetes are prone to subtle volume expansion and low
plasma renin activity, leading to hypoaldosteronism. Since aldosterone is the
major hormone that promotes potassium excretion, hyperkalemia is the pri-
mary electrolyte abnormality. The disorder is typically associated with a
type 4 RTA and a mild metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate usually > 17 mEq/L).
The other illnesses (answer A, DKA; answer B, lactic acidosis; and answer D,
accidental salicylate overdose) cause anion gap acidosis.

CLINICAL PEARLS
All patients with DKA are volume depleted and require significant
»
replacement of salt solution and, later, free water in the form of glucose
solutions.
Despite sometimes elevated initial potassium concentrations, all patients
»
with DKA have a total body potassium deficit and will require substantial
potassium replacement.
Patients with DKA develop an anion gap metabolic acidosis. This acidemia
»
prompts respiratory compensation, resulting in deep and rapid breath-
ing to ventilate carbon dioxide. This is known as Kussmaul breathing.
Glucose levels fall more quickly than ketones resolve. Continuous insulin
»
therapy is necessary for resolution of the ketoacidosis and can be coad-
ministered with a glucose infusion until the anion gap is resolved.
Cerebral edema can result from overly rapid correction of hyperglycemia
»
or possibly from rapid administration of hypotonic fluids.
DKA can be precipitated by either insulin deficiency or a physiologic
»
stressor such as infection.

A 37-year-old, previously healthy woman presents to the clinic for unintentional
weight loss. Over the past 3 months, she has lost approximately 15 lb without
changing her diet or activity level, but she otherwise feels great. She has an
excellent appetite, no gastrointestinal complaints except for occasional loose
stools, and no complaints of fatigue. She denies heat or cold intolerance. On
examination, her heart rate (HR) is 108 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure
(BP) is 142/82 mm Hg, and she is afebrile. When she looks at you, she seems to stare,
and her eyes are somewhat protuberant. You note a large, smooth, nontender
thyroid gland and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur on cardiac examination. Her skin
is warm and dry. There is a fine resting tremor when she spreads her fingers.

ANSWERS TO CASE 53:
Thyrotoxicosis/Graves Disease
Summary: A 37-year-old woman presents with
Three months of unintentional weight loss without anorexia or increased activity level

Tachycardia and borderline hypertension

Exophthalmos

A smooth, nontender goiter

Most likely diagnosis: Thyrotoxicosis/Graves disease.
Confirming the diagnosis: A low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level
and an increased free thyroxine (T ) level with this clinical presentation would con-
4
firm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. However, other tests to define the etiology
include thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs) or diffusely elevated uptake
of radioactive iodine on thyroid scan.
Treatment options: Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or less commonly,
surgical removal of the thyroid.
Considerations in a pregnant patient: Radioactive iodine can cause spontaneous
miscarriage or birth defects during pregnancy and is thus contraindicated.
Methimazole (antithyroid drug) is also contraindicated in the first trimester
of pregnancy.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the clinical presentation of thyrotoxicosis. (EPA 1)
2. Discuss the causes of hyperthyroidism, including Graves disease and toxic
nodule. (EPA 1, 2)
3. List the complications of thyrotoxicosis, including thyroid storm. (EPA 10)
4. Describe the evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule. (EPA 1, 3)
5. Recognize the available treatment options for Graves disease and outcomes of
treatment. (EPA 4)
6. Understand the considerations in management of a pregnant patient with thy-
rotoxicosis. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
This 37-year-old woman has unintentional weight loss, loose stools, and warm
skin, which are all symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Her thyroid gland is diffusely
enlarged and nontender, and she has exophthalmos (protuberant eyes), which is
consistent with Graves disease. This is a systemic disease with many complications
54_Toy-IM_Case53_p547-556.indd 548 24/08/20 3:52 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,576,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 549
that affect the entire body, including osteoporosis and heart failure. Symptomatic
treatments aim to eliminate the excessive thyroid hormone with antithyroid medi-
cation. Definitive therapy consists of radioactive ablative therapy or, less frequently,
surgical excision.
APPROACH TO:
Hyperthyroidism
DEFINITIONS
HYPERTHYROIDISM: Hypermetabolic condition that results from the effect
of excessive amounts of thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland itself.
Because almost all cases of thyrotoxicosis are caused by thyroid overproduction,
these terms are often used synonymously.
THYROID STORM: Rare but life-threatening condition caused by untreated
hyperthyroidism. Can cause severe symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, such as tachycar-
dia, fever, agitation, weakness, delirium, and most fatally, coma or death.
THYROTOXICOSIS: Usually used as a general term for the state of thyroid hor-
mone excess from any source, for example, exogenous ingestion of thyroid hormone
(factitious or iatrogenic).
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism (80%) and usu-
ally is seen in women, especially between the ages of 30 and 50 years. It is an
autoimmune disease caused by autoantibodies that activate the TSH receptor of
the thyroid follicular cell, stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion
as well as thyroid gland growth. In the pregnant patient, these antibodies cross
the placenta and can cause neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The disease might follow a
relapsing and remitting course.
A low serum TSH will confirm the diagnosis. The degree of elevation of serum-
free T and free T (triiodothyronine) levels can give an estimate of the severity of
4 3
the disease. Tests that might be helpful in determining the etiology of thyrotoxi-
cosis include the levels of TSI, which is elevated in Graves disease; thyroid peroxi-
dase antibodies, which are markers of autoimmunity in both Graves disease and
Hashimoto thyroiditis; and a thyroid uptake and scan, which will reveal diffusely
elevated iodine uptake in our patient. Less common causes of thyrotoxicosis include
the following:
Toxic multinodular goiter: Found mainly in elderly and middle-aged patients.
Treatment consists of radioactive iodine or surgery. Radioactive iodine uptake is
normal to increased, and the scan reveals irregular thyroid lobes and a heteroge-
neous pattern.
54_Toy-IM_Case53_p547-556.indd 549 24/08/20 3:52 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,577,"550 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Autonomous hyperfunctioning adenoma (“hot nodule” or Plummer disease): Hyper-
thyroidism usually is not present unless the nodule is more than 3 cm. The iodine
scan looks like the flag of Japan: It demonstrates the hot nodule as having increased
uptake (dark) and the rest of the gland with suppressed uptake (white). Hot
nodules are almost never malignant.
Thyroiditis: Caused by destruction of thyroid tissue and release of preformed
hormone from the colloid space. Subacute (de Quervain) thyroiditis is an inflam-
matory viral illness with thyroid pain and tenderness. The hyperthyroid phase
lasts for several weeks to months, followed by recovery, but some patients will then
develop hypothyroidism. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medica-
tions and beta-blockers usually is sufficient, but in severe cases, glucocorticoids
might be used. Other forms include postradiation, postpartum, subacute (painless
thyroiditis), and amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. In thyroiditis, the radioactive
iodine uptake is decreased.
Pregnancy: The beta subunits of human chorionic gonadotropic (hCG) and TSH
share considerable homology, and thus hCG has weak thyroid-stimulating effects.
This can cause transient hyperthyroidism during peak hCG concentrations. Like-
wise, during normal pregnancy, there are changes in thyroid physiology to meet
the increased metabolic demands. Rises in thyroid hormone-binding globulin can
cause increased total T and total T concentrations without increased free T or
4 3 4
free T concentrations.
3
Medications: Excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone (factitious or iatrogenic),
amiodarone, and iodine load.
Diagnosis. Thyroid function tests indicating low TSH levels and increased free
T or T levels are confirmatory for hyperthyroidism. Once the diagnosis has been
4 3
established, the etiology should be determined. Tests to distinguish the cause of
hyperthyroidism include measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) receptor antibodies,
thyroid scan of radioactive iodine uptake, and measurement of thyroidal blood flow
on ultrasound.
Positive thyrotropin receptor antibodies would indicate Graves disease as the
most likely etiology. Thyroid scans of radioactive iodine uptake measure areas of
thyroid activity. Hot nodules (areas of increased thyroid activity) are likely second-
ary to hyperfunctioning adenoma and are almost never malignant. Cold nodules
(no demonstration of local uptake) have a 5% to 10% risk of malignancy. Fine-
needle aspiration, surgical removal, or ultrasonographic follow-up is needed for
these nodules.
Clinical Presentation
Hyperthyroidism is a multisystemic condition that can affect numerous body
systems (Table 53–1). Weight loss is a common finding, especially in older
patients who develop anorexia. Many patients develop an aversion to heat and a
preference for cold temperatures. In apathetic hyperthyroidism, older patients may
lack typical adrenergic features and present instead with depression or apathy,
weight loss, atrial fibrillation, worsening angina pectoris, or heart failure.

Graves disease is marked by goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), thyroid bruit, hyper-
thyroidism, ophthalmopathy, and dermopathy. These features are variably present.
Ophthalmopathy is characterized by inflammation of extraocular muscles, orbital
fat, and connective tissue, resulting in proptosis (exophthalmos), sometimes with
impairment of eye muscle function (diplopia), and periorbital edema. Ophthal-
mopathy, caused directly by the TSH receptor–directed antibodies, can progress
even after treatment of thyrotoxicosis with antithyroid drugs or radioiodine abla-
tion. Graves dermopathy is characterized by raised hyperpigmented orange peel
texture papules. The most common site is the skin overlying the shins (pretibial
myxedema).
Treatment
Treatment options for hyperthyroidism are medications, radioactive iodine, or surgery.
Medications include beta-blockers such as propranolol (which are used for symptom
relief) and antithyroid drugs such as methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU).
54_Toy-IM_Case53_p547-556.indd 551 24/08/20 3:52 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,579,"552 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
The antithyroid drugs work mainly by decreasing the production of thyroid hor-
mone. They can be used for short-term (prior to treatment with radioactive iodine
or surgery) or long-term (1-2 years) treatment, after which the chance for remis-
sion is 20% to 30%. Possible side effects are rash, allergic reactions, arthritis, hepa-
titis, and agranulocytosis.
For nonpregnant patients, radioactive iodine is usually the treatment of choice
in the United States. It is administered as an oral solution of sodium 131I that is
rapidly concentrated in thyroid tissue, inducing damage that results in ablation of
the thyroid within 6 to 18 weeks. At least 30% of patients will have hypothyroidism
in the first year after treatment and 3% each year after that, requiring thyroid hor-
mone supplementation. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy due to
the risk of miscarriage or birth defects, and women of reproductive age are advised
to postpone pregnancy for 6 to 12 months after treatment. Methimazole is con-
traindicated in the first trimester, but pregnant women with Graves disease can be
managed with PTU, as it has a low transplacental transfer. Graves ophthalmopathy
might be exacerbated by radioactive iodine treatment, so glucocorticoids can be
used to prevent this in selected patients.
Subtotal thyroidectomy usually is reserved for large goiters with obstructive
symptoms (dyspnea, dysphagia). Possible complications include recurrent laryngeal
nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism (due to removal of the parathyroid glands or
compromise of their vascular supply).
For our patient, treatment with radioactive iodine or antithyroid medications
seems the most reasonable way to proceed, and a discussion regarding her options
and our recommendations should take place after the diagnosis is confirmed and
nonpregnant status is confirmed.
Complications
Thyroid storm is a dangerous condition of decompensated thyrotoxicosis. Symp-
toms include severe signs of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia (> 140 bpm),
fever (104 °F to 106 °F), agitation, delirium, restlessness or psychosis, vomiting,
and/or diarrhea. Thyroid storms are usually due to untreated hyperthyroidism
complicated by an intercurrent illness such as infection, surgery, or trauma. Treat-
ment includes supportive care with fluids, beta-blockers to control symptoms of
increased adrenergic tone, antibiotics if needed, and specific treatment directed at
the hyperthyroidism.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
53.1 A 44-year-old woman is being seen in the office for a 2-month history of
progressive anxiety, nervousness, and tremor. She also says she has heat intol-
erance. On exam, her HR is 110 bpm and BP is 130/80 mm Hg. Her thyroid
gland is diffusely enlarged and nontender, and an audible bruit is present. Her
serum TSH level is 0.01 mIU/L (normal 0.35-5.0). Which of the following is
the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lymphocytic thyroiditis
B. Hashimoto thyroiditis
C. Graves disease
D. Multinodular toxic goiter
53.2 A 34-year-old woman is being seen in the urgent care center for “feeling ill.”
She was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 6 months ago, but she has not
taken her medications for 5 days. After the history and physical examination,
the provider is suspicious of possible thyroid storm. Which of the following
features would best distinguish hyperthyroidism from thyroid storm?
A. Heart rate of 120 bpm
B. Weight loss
C. Fever and delirium
D. Large goiter
53.3 A 58-year-old woman is being seen in the office for her first evaluation of
hyperthyroidism. On examination, she is found to have a diffusely slightly
enlarged thyroid gland that is nontender. She has exophthalmos, tremor, and
brisk deep tendon reflexes. Serum TSH is 0.03 mIU/L (normal 0.35-5.0).
Which of the following is the best therapy for this patient?
A. Long-term oral propranolol
B. Lifelong oral PTU
C. Radioactive iodine ablation
D. Surgical thyroidectomy
ANSWERS
53.1 C. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the
United States. It often includes the thyroid gland features described (diffusely
enlarged and nontender), as well as the distinctive eye findings. The patient in
this question does not have exophthalmos described, but its absence does not
rule out Graves disease. The other answer choices (answer A, lymphocytic
thyroiditis; answer B, Hashimoto thyroiditis; and answer D, multinodular
toxic goiter) are less common causes of hyperthyroidism. Patients with multi-
nodular toxic goiter usually have multiple irregular and variable sized nodules
54_Toy-IM_Case53_p547-556.indd 553 24/08/20 3:52 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,581,"554 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
on thyroid palpation, and usually do not present with exophthalmos. The
patient in this scenario does not have exophthalmos (thyroid stare). Only
about 20-30% of patients with Graves disease have these eye findings, and
therefore, their absence does not rule out Graves disease.
53.2 C. Thyroid storm is an exaggeration of hyperthyroid features with autonomic
dysfunction manifesting in fever and/or central nervous system dysfunction,
such as confusion or coma. It is a medical emergency with a high mortality.
Although some patients may have tachycardia (answer A), mild tachycardia
is very common in straightforward hyperthyroidism and not an indicator
of thyroid storm. Weight loss (answer B) and a large goiter (answer D) can
occur with hyperthyroidism and are not distinguishing factors. Other find-
ings of thyroid storm include heart failure and a markedly elevated BP.
53.3 C. This patient most likely has Graves disease based on the symptoms of
hyperthyroidism, mildly enlarged goiter, eye findings, and low TSH level.
Radioactive iodine is a definitive treatment for Graves disease. Surgery
(answer D) is indicated for obstructive symptoms or for women during preg-
nancy. Propranolol (answer A) is a good initial option to control tachycardia
but not a long-term option. PTU (answer B) is a second-line option due to
the risk of hepatocellular necrosis; long-term medical therapy with methima-
zole is the preferred agent in the United States and is used in many cases.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis is Graves disease. No other
»
diagnosis is likely if the patient has bilateral proptosis and a goiter.
In patients with Graves disease, thyrotoxic symptoms may be treated
»
with antithyroid medication or by thyroid gland ablation with radioactive
iodine or surgery, but the ophthalmopathy may not improve.
Graves disease may remit and relapse; in patients treated medically,
»
one-third to half will become asymptomatic within 1–2 years.
After radioactive iodine ablation, most patients with Graves disease will
»
have hypothyroidism and require thyroid hormone supplementation.
Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules (excessive thyroid hormone pro-
»
duction, suppressed TSH, “hot” on radionuclide scan) almost never are
malignant.
Most “cold” thyroid nodules are not malignant, but fine-needle aspiration
»
should be used to evaluate the need for surgical excision.

A healthy 52-year-old man presents to the office complaining of increasing fatigue
for the past 4 to 5 months. He exercises every day, and lately he has noticed
becoming short of breath while jogging. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, or swelling in his ankles. The patient reports occasional joint
pain, for which he frequently uses over-the-counter ibuprofen. He denies bowel
changes, melena, or bright red blood per rectum, but he reports vague left-sided
abdominal pain for a few months off and on unrelated to food intake. The patient
denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. He has lost a few pounds intentionally
with diet and exercise.
On examination, the patient weighs 205 lb and is afebrile. There is slight pallor
of the conjunctiva, skin, and palms. No lymphadenopathy is noted. Chest is clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Examination of the cardiovascular system reveals a
regular rate and rhythm, with no rub or gallop. There is a systolic ejection murmur.
His abdomen is soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel sounds
are present. He has no extremity edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. His peripheral
pulses are palpable and symmetric. His hemoglobin level is 8.2 g/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 54:
Iron-Deficiency Anemia
Summary: A 52-year-old man presents with
A 4- to 5-month history of increasing exercise intolerance

Regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use

Systolic ejection murmur and pallor on examination

Hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL

Most likely diagnosis: Chronic blood loss and iron-deficiency anemia, possibly due
to regular NSAID use.
Next diagnostic step: Analyze the complete blood count (CBC), particularly the
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), to determine if the anemia is microcytic, nor-
mocytic, or macrocytic; assess the leukocyte count and platelet count.
Risk factors: NSAID or anticoagulant use, iron-poor intake, gastrointestinal (GI)
disorder (eg, celiac disease, autoimmune gastritis), or menses.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize iron-deficiency anemia as the most common cause of anemia.
(EPA 1, 2)
2. Describe the diagnostic approach to anemia. (EPA 3)
3. Identify the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This 52-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of fatigue and dyspnea
on exertion for the few months prior to the office visit. His physical examination is
significant only for pallor. The serum hemoglobin level confirms anemia. The next
step would be to characterize the anemia; if it is microcytic, which would be con-
sistent with iron deficiency, confirmation should be performed with further testing
for total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and ferritin. In the postmenopausal female
or adult male, iron-deficiency anemia indicates GI tract blood loss until proven oth-
erwise, with colon cancer being the most serious possibility. This patient is using
an NSAID, which may predispose to erosive gastritis. Once iron-deficiency anemia
is confirmed, a thorough evaluation, including upper and lower endoscopy of the
GI tract, is needed.

APPROACH TO:
Iron-Deficiency Anemia
DEFINITIONS
ANEMIA: Decreased red blood cell (RBC) mass, leading to less oxygen-carrying
capacity. Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level less than 13 g/dL in men and less
than 12 g/dL in women.
IRON STUDIES: Ferritin is a marker of iron stores and is decreased in cases
of iron deficiency. It is also an acute-phase reactant and therefore increases with
inflammatory chronic diseases. The TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin
saturation levels and increases in iron deficiency.
MEAN CORPUSCULAR VOLUME: MCV is the average of RBC volume. Based
on RBC size, anemia is categorized as microcytic (MCV < 80 fL), normocytic
(MCV 80-100 fL), and macrocytic (MCV > 100 fL).
RETICULOCYTE: An immature RBC that usually is 1 to 1.5 days old.
RETICULOCYTE COUNT: A fraction of RBCs consisting of reticulocytes that
indirectly indicates the bone marrow activity of the erythrocyte line. It is usually
expressed as a percentage, with a normal value of 0.5% to 2% in nonanemic adults;
the reticulocyte index adjusts the count for the level of anemia.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia in the United States,
affecting all ages and both genders. Iron is essential to the synthesis of hemoglobin.
The normal daily intake of elemental iron is approximately 15 mg, of which only
1 to 2 mg are absorbed. The daily iron losses are about the same, and menstruation
adds approximately 30 mg of iron lost each month.
When iron loss exceeds intake, iron deposits are gradually depleted. Hemoglo-
bin and serum iron levels may remain normal in the initial stages, and decreasing
serum ferritin (iron stores) levels can be one of the first changes seen. This leads to a
progressive decrease in iron available for RBC formation. The liver tries to compen-
sate for this change by increasing transferrin production and maximizing the use of
available iron. Transferrin levels are indirectly measured by TIBC. Due to increased
transferrin production, TIBC is high in patients with iron-deficiency anemia. As a
result, transferrin saturation (serum iron divided by TIBC) is low. Initially anemia
will have normal-appearing RBCs, but as anemia becomes more severe, microcyto-
sis and hypochromia will develop. Later in the disease process, iron deficiency will
affect other tissues, resulting in a variety of symptoms and signs.
Etiologies. The primary etiology for iron-deficiency anemia is blood loss
(Table 54–1). In men, the most frequent cause is chronic GI tract occult bleed-
ing; gastroenterology referral and endoscopic study of potential blood losses
should be considered. In women, menstrual loss may be the main mechanism,

Table 54–1 • COMMON CAUSES OF IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
BLOOD LOSS
Gastrointestinal blood loss
• Esophageal varices
• Peptic ulcer disease
• Gastritis (eg, NSAID induced)
• Small bowel polyp or carcinoma
• Colonic angiodysplasia
• Colon cancer
• Inflammatory bowel disease (eg, ulcerative colitis)
• Hookworm infestation
Uterine blood loss
• Menstruation/menorrhagia
• Uterine fibroids
Other blood loss
• Chronic hemodialysis
• Surgical blood loss
• Repeated blood donation or phlebotomy
• Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
MALABSORPTION
• Gastrectomy
• Celiac disease
• Inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn disease)
INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE/INCREASED PHYSIOLOGIC DEMANDS
• Infancy/adolescence
• Pregnancy
• Vegetarian diet
but other causes must be considered. During pregnancy, iron transfer from the
mother to the developing fetus makes supplemental iron especially important.
Iron deficiency may also be a result of increased iron requirements, diminished
iron absorption, or both. Iron deficiency can develop during the first 2 years of
life if dietary iron is insufficient for the demands of rapid growth. Adolescent
girls may become iron deficient from inadequate oral intake in addition to the
loss from menstruation. The growth spurt in adolescent boys may also produce a
significant increase in demands for iron. Less common than blood loss are other
possible causes of anemia, such as decreased iron absorption after gastrectomy or
malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease.
Sideroblastic anemia is a disease in which the bone marrow produces abnormal
RBCs, commonly microcytic and hypochromic. It can be both acquired and con-
genital, with X-lined sideroblastic anemia and isoniazid being some of the more
common etiologies of microcytic sideroblastic anemia. The iron studies in sidero-
blastic anemia include increases in serum iron, serum ferritin concentration, and
saturation of transferrin. Iron stain of the bone marrow (Prussian blue) reveals
the pathognomonic feature of engorged mitochondria in the developing RBCs,
called ringed sideroblasts (Figure 54–1). Another important clue to the presence
of sideroblastic anemia is the presence of stippled RBCs in the peripheral blood
smear (Figure 54–2); this is also seen in heavy lead exposure.

Categorizing Anemias by MCV. A CBC with differential, platelets, and RBC
indices is helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis of anemia. The first step
is to look at the MCV to categorize the anemia (Table 54–2). Iron deficiency usu-
ally leads to a microcytic anemia. The RBC distribution width (RDW) is a calcu-
lated index that quantitates the anisocytosis (variation in the RBC size) and helps
to distinguish uncomplicated iron deficiencies from uncomplicated thalassemia.
Microcytic anemia with an increased RDW is suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia
because the bone marrow produces new erythrocytes of various sizes. A normal
RDW in the presence of microcytic anemia is more suggestive of chronic disease,
thalassemia, or even iron deficiency with concomitant anemia of chronic disease.

A detailed history, physical examination, and further laboratory data may be neces-
sary to achieve a final diagnosis.
Reticulocyte Count. The reticulocyte count is another important parameter
to help in the differential diagnosis of anemia. A new RBC can be stained as a
reticulocyte for 24 to 36 hours, after which the RBC circulates for approximately
120 days. The blood normally contains about 1 reticulocyte per 100 RBCs. The
reticulocyte count is the percentage of reticulocytes per 100 RBCs, and it may be
falsely elevated in the presence of anemia. Therefore, a corrected reticulocyte count
(CRC) is calculated by multiplying the reported reticulocyte count by the patient’s
hematocrit divided by 45 (normal hematocrit), or hemoglobin divided by 15.
Reticulocyte Production Index. Another calculated measure to assess anemia is to
look at the bone marrow response using the reticulocyte production index (RPI).
The RPI accounts for prematurely released reticulocytes, or shift cells, as they have
a longer life span and can lead to overestimation of daily RBC production. RPI can
be calculated by dividing the CRC by 2.
For example, if the patient’s reticulocyte count is 6% and hematocrit 18, then
RPI =
CRC
=
6 * (18/45)
= 1.2
2 2
An RPI less than 2 indicates that the patient’s bone marrow is not responding
to the anemia and not making enough reticulocytes; therefore, a hypoproliferative
bone marrow disorder should be suspected. A normal or high reticulocyte count
(RPI > 3) indicates that the marrow is responding appropriately to the anemia,
suggestive of acute blood loss, hemolysis, or a response to therapy for anemia.
Iron Studies. Iron studies are very helpful to confirm a diagnosis of iron-deficiency
anemia and to help in the differential diagnosis of other types of anemia, such as
anemia of chronic disease and sideroblastic anemia (Table 54–3). These studies
include serum iron levels, serum TIBC, and calculation of percentage saturation

of transferrin. Low serum ferritin concentration is a reliable indication of iron
deficiency. Serum ferritin values are increased with chronic inflammatory disease,
malignancy, or liver injury; therefore, serum ferritin concentration may be above
normal when iron deficiency exists with chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis, Hodgkin disease, or hepatitis, among many other disorders.
Peripheral Blood Smear. Evaluating the peripheral blood smear for specific
abnormalities in RBC morphology may be very useful for determining the etiol-
ogy of anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear shows RBCs
smaller than normal (microcytes) and hypochromia (Figure 54–3).

Clinical Presentation
Anemia is most commonly diagnosed by a routine laboratory test, and patients
are often asymptomatic. The lack of symptoms reflects the very slow development
of iron deficiency and the ability of the body to adapt to lower iron reserves and
anemia. More severe anemia may produce symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of
breath, dizziness, headache, palpitations, and impaired concentration. Addition-
ally, patients with chronic severe iron deficiency may develop pica, which involves
cravings for nonfood objects such as dirt, paint, and ice. It is also linked to restless
legs syndrome. Glossitis, cheilosis, or koilonychia may develop, and in rare cases,
dysphagia associated with a postcricoid esophageal web (also known as Plummer-
Vinson syndrome) may occur.
Treatment
Although the treatment of iron deficiency is straightforward, finding the underly-
ing etiology is paramount. Treatment of iron-deficiency anemia consists of iron
replacement therapy, typically with oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg two or three times
daily, which provides 130 to 195 mg of elemental iron. Other iron preparations,
such as ferrous fumarate or ferrous gluconate, can also be used and are equally
effective. Correction of anemia usually occurs within 6 weeks, but therapy should
continue for at least 6 months to replenish the iron stores. Oral iron therapy may
cause GI side effects, such as constipation, nausea, and abdominal cramping.
Taking the iron with meals may help with tolerance but can reduce absorption.
Failure of iron-deficiency anemia to improve with oral iron supplementation sug-
gests nonadherence to therapy, possible coexisting disease interfering with mar-
row response (eg, coexisting folate or B deficiency), or malabsorption of iron (eg,
12
celiac sprue, atrophic gastritis). Parenteral iron therapy is indicated in patients with
a poor absorption state (occurs in celiac disease, chronic kidney disease) or with
excessive intolerance to oral therapy. Caution must be taken with parenteral high-
molecular-weight iron dextran because anaphylaxis may occur. Newer parenteral
iron compounds are now available with lower rates of adverse events.
It should be emphasized once again that after the diagnosis of iron deficiency is
established, the cause of the iron loss should be identified. Except in menstruating
women, the most common site of blood loss is the GI tract, and most patients will
require endoscopic evaluation. Gastritis, peptic ulcers, and angiodysplasia are all
common sources of blood loss, but the most serious diagnosis to exclude would be
the possibility of an occult GI malignancy. Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), such
as a stool guaiac test, should not be used as a substitute for endoscopic evaluation,
as even high-sensitivity FOBT has only 50% to 80% sensitivity for colorectal
cancer.

ANSWERS
54.1 A. Chronic GI blood loss leads to low ferritin levels, reflecting diminished
iron stores; elevated TIBC; and low iron saturation. There is a microcytic
anemia (low MCV) with a low reticulocyte count. The reticulocyte count
would be elevated (answer D) with acute blood loss, but the patient has not
experienced this. An elevated MCV of 105 fL (answer B) would be indicative
of macrocytic anemia such as folate or vitamin B deficiency, whereas iron
12
deficiency is suggestive of microcytic anemia. Serum ferritin levels (answer C)
would be decreased in iron deficiency.
54.2 A. Iron deficiency occurs in pregnancy as a result of the expanded blood
volume and active transport of iron to the fetus. Hemolysis (answer B) and
occult GI blood loss (answer D) would not be normal findings in pregnancy
and would warrant further workup. Iron loss does not occur due to alkalosis
(answer C).
55_Toy-IM_Case54_p557-568.indd 566 02/09/20 7:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,594,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 567
54.3 A. Macrocytic anemia is usually a result of folate or vitamin B deficiency.
12
Vitamin B stores last for nearly 10 years; therefore, a dietary change of sev-
12
eral months would more likely cause folate deficiency. Folate is found in green
leafy vegetables. Vitamin B deficiency (answer E) can also lead to neurologic
12
symptoms. Iron deficiency (answer B), thalassemias (answer D), and sidero-
blastic anemias (answer C) will likely be microcytic with an MCV < 80 fL.
54.4 B. This patient has ongoing blood loss from heavy menses leading to iron-
deficiency anemia, with characteristic laboratory test values (low MCV, low
ferritin, high TIBC, high RDW). Treatment of choice is oral iron supple-
mentation. Intravenous iron formulations (answer E) are indicated only in
specific situations, such as inability to tolerate oral iron and malabsorption.
Demonstration of a failure of oral therapy is often needed prior to intrave-
nous iron treatment. Iron dextran is rarely used due to concern for anaphy-
laxis. In addition, the patient has a clear etiology for iron loss, so endoscopy
(answer C) is not indicated. Transfusion (answer A) is reserved for patients
with hemoglobin < 7 g/dL or hemoglobin < 8 g/dL if symptomatic. Oral
folic acid supplementation (answer D) would not be contraindicated in this
case but is not as important as iron supplementation. Typically, vitamin C is
also provided in addition to the oral iron to enhance intestinal absorption.
54.5 D. Thalassemia usually leads to a microcytic anemia with uniform red cell
size (normal RDW) and excess iron stores. The patient’s asymptomatic ane-
mia, ethnicity, and family member with transfusion-dependent anemia are
consistent with alpha-thalassemia minor. Alpha-thalassemia minor can have
normal hemoglobin electrophoresis, and diagnosis requires DNA sequencing.
Checking lead levels (answer A) would be indicated if there is suggestive his-
tory, such as occupational exposure or living in an old house with lead-based
paint. Repeating hemoglobin electrophoresis (answer B) does not increase
sensitivity for the diagnosis of thalassemia. A bone marrow biopsy (answer C)
is indicated when there is suggestion of a bone marrow process such as com-
promise of more than one cell line (eg, anemia and/or leukopenia and/or
thrombocytopenia). Iron sulfate supplementation (answer E) is not indicated
since serum iron stores are in excess and supplementation may lead to iron
toxicity.
54.6 C. The patient has an inflammatory condition (rheumatoid arthritis) that
would cause an anemia of chronic disease. The typical parameters with
chronic inflammation would be a normocytic (normal to slightly low MCV),
normal to high serum ferritin level (due to inability to mobilize iron), and low
serum iron levels (due to lack of iron in circulation). Although a microcytic
anemia can be seen, normocytic anemia with elevated ferritin (acute-phase
reactant) is more common in chronic disease. Answer A (high MCV, normal
to elevated ferritin, normal TIBC, and normal serum iron levels) is consistent
with a folate or vitamin B deficiency. Answer B (borderline low MCV,
12
high/normal ferritin, TIBC normal, and normal serum iron level) is consis-
tent with sideroblastic anemia. Answer D (low MCV, low ferritin, high TIBC,
55_Toy-IM_Case54_p557-568.indd 567 02/09/20 7:02 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,595,"568 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
and low iron levels) is consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. Answer E
(normal/high MCV, normal ferritin, low TIBC, normal serum iron) is consis-
tent with hemochromatosis (iron overload).
CLINICAL PEARLS
The values for MCV, RDW, and RPI are important parameters in the evalu-
»
ation of anemia.
Reticulocyte production index < 2 in an anemic patient is indicative of
»
hypoproliferative bone marrow disorder.
Think of iron deficiency in an anemic patient with low MCV, low ferritin,
»
and low RPI.
Iron-deficiency anemia in men or postmenopausal women is primarily a
»
result of GI blood losses; therefore, iron-deficiency anemia in this patient
population warrants a thorough GI workup.
Iron-deficiency anemia in reproductive age women is most often caused
»
by menstrual blood loss.
Fecal occult blood testing is negative in approximately 20% to 50% of
»
patients with colorectal cancer. Therefore, a negative fecal occult blood
test in the presence of iron-deficiency anemia should not discourage you
from pursuing a thorough GI workup if clinically indicated.

examination, his temperature is 99 °F, blood pressure (BP) is 124/92 mm Hg lying
down and 95/70 mm Hg upon standing, heart rate (HR) is 104 beats per minute
(bpm), respiratory rate (RR) is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%
on room air. On physical examination, he appears pale and diaphoretic. His neck
veins are flat, his chest is clear to auscultation, and his heart rhythm is tachycardic
but regular, with a soft systolic murmur at the right sternal border and an S
4
gallop. His apical impulse is focal and nondisplaced. His abdominal examination
is positive for mild epigastric tenderness. Rectal examination shows black, sticky
stool and is positive for occult blood. His hemoglobin level is 5.9 g/dL. Prothrombin
time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are both normal, as are his renal
and liver function tests. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals sinus tachycardia with
no ST-segment changes, T-wave inversion in the anterior precordial leads, and no
ventricular ectopy. Creatine kinase (CK) is 127 U/L with a normal creatine kinase
myocardial band (CK-MB) fraction, and troponin I levels are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 55:
Symptomatic Anemia and Transfusion Medicine
Summary: A 62-year-old man presents with
A recent NSTEMI without major blockage

Angina at rest without electrocardiographic changes

Tachycardia with orthostatic hypotension, which indicates major hypovolemia from

blood loss
Melena and hemoglobin 5.9 g/dL, suggesting upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemor-

rhage, possibly from antiplatelet agents
Most likely diagnosis: Unstable angina, which has been precipitated by anemia sec-
ondary to acute GI blood loss.
Next step: Transfusion with packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
Possible complications: There are a multitude of transfusion complications, ranging
from transmission of infections (hepatitis C, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency
virus [HIV], etc) to reactions such as acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, febrile
nonhemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI),
and anaphylaxis.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the indications for transfusion of red blood cells. (EPA 1, 4)
2. Recognize the indications for transfusion of platelets and of fresh frozen
plasma (FFP). (EPA 1, 4)
3. Describe the complications of transfusions. (EPA 10)
4. Be aware of alternatives to transfusion. (EPA 4, 12)
Considerations
This 62 year old patient has two urgent problems, the upper GI hemorrhage and
acute coronary syndrome, which is most likely unstable angina. The first set of
cardiac enzymes are negative, but another set is important to obtain to definitely
rule out acute MI. The patient had a recent coronary angiography which did not
show blockage; thus, the severe anemia likely is causing the chest pain and ECG
findings, consistent with unstable angina. The unstable angina may be the result
of decreased oxygen supply to the heart due to blood loss. Thus, replacing blood
volume treats both problems. Importantly, restoration of oxygen delivery to the
heart is critical to avoid myocardial necrosis. The hemoglobin level of 5.9 g/dL
may not be reflective of the true severity of anemia. Acutely, because patients bleed
whole blood, the ratio of red cells to plasma volume does not change. It is only after
volume repletion and restoration of the intravascular volume that we may see the
56_Toy-IM_Case55_p569-576.indd 570 24/08/20 3:56 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,598,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 571
true hemoglobin level. Meanwhile, another consideration is that transfusion that is
too rapid may lead to volume overload, if the patient has any degree of heart failure.
Thus, this patient is very complex and fragile, and should be monitored carefully in
the critical care area.
APPROACH TO:
Transfusion Medicine
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE HEMOLYTIC REACTION: Transfusion reaction due to antibody lysis
of transfused red blood cells.
NON–ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: Clinical features of
unstable angina, but with evidence of myocardial necrosis such as elevated cardiac
biomarkers.
TRANSFUSION-RELATED ACUTE LUNG INJURY: Immune-mediated lung
injury in reaction to any blood product. Characterized by acute respiratory distress
occurring during or within 6 hours of the transfusion.
UNSTABLE ANGINA: Angina pectoris or equivalent ischemic discomfort occur-
ring at rest, or severe and new onset, or in a crescendo pattern. Unstable angina,
unlike NSTEMI or STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), does
not cause elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers or ST-segment elevation on ECG.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Anemia
Anemia occurs when the hemoglobin level is less than 12 g/dL in women or less than
13 g/dL in men. Symptoms attributable to anemia are manifold and depend pri-
marily on the patient’s underlying cardiopulmonary status and the chronicity with
which the anemia developed. For a slowly developing, chronic anemia in patients
with good cardiopulmonary reserve, symptoms may not present until hemoglobin
levels are as low as 3 or 4 g/dL. Patients with serious underlying cardiopulmonary
disease who depend on adequate oxygen-carrying capacity may become symptom-
atic with smaller drops in hemoglobin.
Packed Red Blood Cells
Indications for transfusion of PRBCs are acute surgical or nonsurgical blood loss;
anemia with end-organ effects (eg, syncope, angina pectoris) or hemodynamic com-
promise; and critical illness to improve oxygen-carrying capacity or delivery to tis-
sues. There are no absolute guidelines or thresholds for transfusion. Many believe
that a hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL is adequate in the absence of a clearly defined
increased need, such as cardiac ischemia, for which a hematocrit level of at least
30% may be desired. In the absence of ongoing bleeding or destruction of red cells,
we typically expect that each unit of PRBCs will result in an increase of 1 g/dL in
56_Toy-IM_Case55_p569-576.indd 571 24/08/20 3:56 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,599,"572 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
the hemoglobin level or 3% in the hematocrit level. In addition to PRBCs, there are
other components of whole blood, including platelets, FFP, cryoprecipitate, and
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).
Platelets and Fresh Frozen Plasma
Thrombocytopenia can frequently be treated with platelet transfusion. When a
patient has a platelet count of less than 50,000/mm3 and has significant bleed-
ing, or when a patient is at risk for spontaneous bleeding with a level of less than
10,000/mm3, platelets can be transfused. Each unit increases the platelet count
from 5000 to 10,000/mm3. Transfusion is generally not helpful in cases of plate-
let destruction, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), unless active,
severe bleeding occurs. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in patients with
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), as it may worsen microvascular
thrombosis and cause worsening neurologic symptoms or renal failure.
Fresh Frozen Plasma. FFP replaces clotting factors and is often given to reverse
warfarin (Coumadin) anticoagulation. Cryoprecipitate from FFP replaces fibrino-
gen and some clotting factors, making it useful in patients with hemophilia A and
von Willebrand disease.
Alternatives to Transfusions
Erythropoietin, a hormone that promotes red cell production, is often used in the
treatment of renal failure–related anemia or in patients who are banking a presurgi-
cal autologous transfusion to encourage quicker recovery of their hemoglobin levels
prior to surgery. Cell savers salvage some intraoperative blood losses, which are
then transfused back into the patient. Some patients may not wish to have foreign
blood products transfused. In these cases, we can increase the baseline hemoglobin
level by using erythropoietin and iron before planned surgery, minimize phlebot-
omy for laboratory testing, and use cell savers during surgery.
Complications
Infection. Viruses that are screened for but can still be transmitted include hepatitis
C virus (1 in 103,000 units), human T-cell lymphocyte virus types I and II, HIV
(1 in 700,000), hepatitis B virus (1 in 66,000), and parvovirus B19. Rarely, bacterial
contamination (eg, Yersinia enterocolitica) causes fevers, sepsis, and even death dur-
ing or soon after transfusion. Parasites (eg, malaria) are screened for by questioning
a donor’s medical and travel history.
Immune-Mediated Complications. With respect to immune mechanisms, it is
possible that a recipient has preformed natural antibodies that lyse foreign donor
erythrocytes, which can be associated with the major A and/or B or O blood types
or with other antigens (eg, D, Duffy, Kidd). To avoid hemolysis, a “type and cross”
is first performed, in which blood samples are tested for compatibility prior to
transfusion.
An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is caused by ABO incompatibil-
ity due to clerical error, typically occurs within 1 hour of the transfusion being
started. It may be associated with hypotension, fever, chills, hemoglobinuria, flank
pain, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and renal failure. This is a medi-
cal emergency, so transfusion must be halted immediately, and fluids, specifically
56_Toy-IM_Case55_p569-576.indd 572 24/08/20 3:56 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,600,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 573
normal saline, should be started urgently to prevent progression into renal failure.
Lactated Ringer’s solution and fluids with dextrose should be avoided; the calcium
content in lactated Ringer’s may cause clotting of blood in the intravenous line, and
dextrose can cause hemolysis of red blood cells in the intravenous line. Diuretics
may be used in those with volume overload if the patient is not hypotensive; in
severe cases, dialysis may be initiated to protect from kidney failure via immune-
complex deposits. Laboratory tests for intravascular hemolysis should be checked
(lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin), as well as coagula-
tion tests for DIC.
Delayed hemolytic reactions are less predictable and usually milder; these reac-
tions involve amnestic responses from the recipient. They range from urticaria
treated with diphenhydramine and transfusion interruption to anaphylaxis, in
which case the transfusion must be stopped and epinephrine and steroids given.
Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, thought to result from production of
leukocyte cytokines during storage, can be treated by antipyretics and prevented by
leukoreduction. Sometimes TRALI occurs, in which case the appearance of bilat-
eral interstitial infiltrates in the lung represents noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Nonimmune Complications. Considering nonimmune consequences, the transfu-
sion itself supplies 300 mL of fluid per unit of PRBCs intravascularly, so patients
can easily become volume overloaded. Adjusting the volume and rate and using
diuretics will prevent this complication. Each unit of blood also provides 250 mg of
iron. Multiple and frequent transfusions can cause iron overload and deposition
(hemosiderosis), leading to cirrhosis, cardiac problems (eg, arrhythmia, heart fail-
ure), or diabetes.

55.2 A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for 6 months of
severe menorrhagia. Initial vital signs reveal a temperature of 98.2 °F, BP of
105/82 mm Hg, HR of 102 bpm, RR of 14 breaths/min, and oxygen satura-
tion 95% on room air. Laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL.
She feels dizzy, weak, and fatigued. She receives 3 units of packed erythro-
cytes intravenously. Two hours into the transfusion, she develops fever to
103 °F and shaking chills. Which of the following laboratory tests would
most likely confirm an acute transfusion reaction?
A. Direct bilirubin level
B. Glucose level
C. LDH level
D. Leukocyte count
55.3 A 57-year-old man on warfarin with a past medical history of hypertension
and aortic stenosis with prosthetic aortic valve replacement is brought to the
emergency department by his wife. He is noted to have an international nor-
malized ratio (INR) of 7 and is actively bleeding large clots from his gums
and rectum and when urinating. Which of the following is the best next step
in management?
A. Administer IVIg.
B. Administer vitamin D.
C. Discontinue the warfarin and observe.
D. Transfuse FFP.
55.4 A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of
weakness, dizziness, and fatigue. Her menstrual period started 4 days ago,
and she has been having heavier than normal bleeding, soaking through four
or five pads a day. She appears pale on physical examination. On initial vitals,
she is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Hemoglobin level is 6.6 g/dL.
One unit of red blood cells is ordered. One hour into the transfusion, she
complains of chills and flank pain. Vitals reveal a temperature of 101.5 °F, BP
of 95/70 mm Hg, HR of 110 bpm, RR of 18 breaths/min, and O saturation
2
of 95% on room air. The blood transfusion is immediately stopped. Which of
the following is the best next step in management?
A. Antibiotics
B. Furosemide
C. Methylprednisolone
D. Normal saline
ANSWERS
55.1 C. This patient needs a blood transfusion immediately, as evidenced by his dan-
gerously low BP. He does not have the 45 minutes required for crossmatching
his blood (answer A). Even though the patient’s wife is “absolutely sure” about
the blood type being type A (answer D), history is not completely reliable.
56_Toy-IM_Case55_p569-576.indd 574 24/08/20 3:56 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,602,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 575
In an emergent situation such that uncrossmatched blood must be given,
O-negative blood (universal donor) (answer C) usually is administered.
Giving AB-positive blood, uncrossmatched (answer B), is not the best treat-
ment for this patient in any circumstance.
55.2 C. This patient is suffering from acute hemolytic transfusion reaction char-
acterized by fever, hypotension, and hemolysis. Elevated LDH and indirect
bilirubin levels or decreased haptoglobin levels would be consistent with
hemolysis. Glucose (answer B), direct bilirubin (answer A), and leukocyte
count (answer D) are not direct markers of hemolysis.
55.3 D. This patient has active bleeding, so watching and observing (answer C)
is not an option. When life-threatening acute bleeding occurs in the face of
coagulopathy due to warfarin use, the treatment is FFP. The INR is extremely
high, consistent with a severe coagulopathy. IVIg (answer A) is not treatment
for bleeding secondary to supratherapeutic INR; IVIg is used in the treat-
ment of immune thrombocytopenia. Vitamin D (answer B) does not have a
primary role in coagulation, whereas vitamin K does have a primary role.
55.4 D. This patient is likely experiencing an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction,
as evidenced by his fever, hypotension, and flank pain an hour after red blood
cell transfusion. Treatment includes immediately stopping the transfusion
and starting normal saline to prevent the progression to renal failure. Diuretics
(answer B) can be used to prevent oliguric renal failure, but this patient is
hypotensive, so that would not be the next step. This patient spiked a fever,
but this is likely a result of a transfusion reaction rather than sepsis at this
point. Therefore, antibiotics (answer A) are not yet warranted. Methylpred-
nisolone (answer C), which is a potent corticosteroid, has not been shown to
be effective in treating acute transfusion reactions but is sometimes used as an
adjunct medication for anaphylactic reactions following transfusions.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The symptoms of anemia are related to the onset time with which the
»
anemia developed as well as the patients’ underlying cardiopulmonary
status.
Myocardial ischemia or infarction may be precipitated by factors related
»
to loss of oxygen-carrying capacity.
Transfusion of blood carries certain risks, such as hemolytic reaction,
»
infection (ie, HIV and hepatitis C), and transfusion-related lung injury.
Platelet transfusions are indicated for severe thrombocytopenia with
»
bleeding symptoms, but they have limited benefit in ITP and are defi-
nitely contraindicated in TTP.
Fresh frozen plasma is used to correct coagulopathy by providing clot-
»
ting factors.

A 26-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining
of bleeding from her nose and mouth that started last night. She also noticed
small, reddish spots on her lower extremities when she got out of the bed this
morning. She denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or joint pain.
The patient reports she had developed an upper respiratory infection 2 weeks
prior to the emergency department visit, but the infection resolved. She has no
current medical problems. Her menses have been normal, and her last menstrual
period was approximately 2 weeks ago. She denies excessive bleeding in the past.
Prior to this episode, she never had epistaxis, easy bruising, or bleeding into her
joints. There is no family history of abnormal bleeding. The patient does not take
any medications.
On examination, she is alert, oriented, and somewhat anxious. Her blood
pressure (BP) is 110/70 mm Hg, her heart rate (HR) is 90 beats per minute (bpm),
and she is afebrile. No pallor or jaundice is noted. There is bright red blood oozing

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize causes of bleeding disorders, including those affecting platelets and
coagulation factors. (EPA 1, 2)
2. Differentiate causes of thrombocytopenia, specifically thrombocytopenic pur-
pura versus other platelet disorders, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated intra-
vascular coagulation (DIC). (EPA 2, 3)
3. Describe the treatment of ITP. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This patient presents with mucosal bleeding, petechiae, and thrombocytopenia.
She has no other history, symptoms, or physical examination findings of any sys-
temic disease; thus, her problem appears to an isolated hematologic problem.
A CBC is important to ensure that other cell lines are normal; if abnormal, con-
ditions such as acute leukemia or a bone marrow infiltrative process must be
considered and cannot be ruled out. A peripheral smear would also be helpful
in teasing out the etiology of her thrombocytopenia. Her coagulation studies
(PT and PTT) are also normal; if they were deranged, we would suspect a con-
sumptive coagulopathy causing the thrombocytopenia and a serious underlying
disorder. Her current platelet count does not pose a risk for spontaneous hem-
orrhage, but counts lower than 10,000/µL might place her at risk for serious or
life-threatening bleeding.

APPROACH TO:
Abnormal Bleeding
DEFINITIONS
HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME: A clinical complex consisting of pro-
gressive renal failure that is associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
and thrombocytopenia.
IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA: A hematologic disorder
characterized by the destruction of blood platelets due to the presence of antiplate-
let autoantibodies.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Platelet count of less than 150,000/µL.
THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA: A life-threatening
syndrome characterized by a pentad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, throm-
bocytopenia, neurologic abnormalities, fever, and renal dysfunction.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Background. For a patient with abnormal bleeding, it is important to screen for pre-
vious episodes of bleeding, even if it affected other bodily areas. It is necessary to
ask about a history of recurrent epistaxis, menorrhagia, excessive prolonged bleed-
ing from minor cuts, dental extraction, major surgery, obstetric delivery, or trauma.
Excessive mucosal bleeding (eg, gum and nose bleeding) and petechiae are sugges-
tive of thrombocytopenia or abnormal platelet function such as von Willebrand
disease (vWD). On the other hand, more severe bleeds such as hemarthrosis, deep
hematomas, and retroperitoneal bleeding are more likely signs of a severe coagula-
tion abnormality, such as hemophilia due to factor VIII or IX deficiencies.
Definition and Causes. Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less
than 150,000/µL, although spontaneous bleeding usually occurs at much lower
platelet counts. The causes of thrombocytopenia can be divided into (1) decreased
platelet production, (2) decreased platelet survival, (3) sequestration (hypersplen-
ism), and (4) dilutional.
Impaired platelet production is caused by bone marrow abnormalities. Examples
include marrow infiltration by malignancy or myelofibrosis and marrow suppres-
sion resulting from exposure to chemicals, drugs, radiation, or viruses. In bone
marrow diseases, thrombocytopenia is often accompanied by abnormalities in the
other cell lines.
Decreased platelet survival is another cause of thrombocytopenia. Hemolytic
reactions represent a prime example. They can be caused by infection, medications,
autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), HELLP (hemolysis, ele-
vated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, and other etiologies. Decreased plate-
let survival can also be due to splenic sequestration in patients with splenomegaly
due to various reasons (eg, portal hypertension, myelofibrosis).
57_Toy-IM_Case56_p577-586.indd 579 24/08/20 3:57 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,607,"580 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
When a patient presents with thrombocytopenia, any drug that the patient
is using should be considered a possible cause. Common drugs known to cause
thrombocytopenia include H blockers, quinine, and sulfonamides. In general, the
2
diagnosis is made by clinical observation of the response to drug withdrawal. Dis-
continuation of the offending medication should lead to improvement in the plate-
let count within a time frame consistent with the drug’s metabolism, almost always
within 7 to 10 days.
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura
Acute ITP is most common in early childhood, often following an upper respira-
tory infection; it is usually self-limiting. ITP in children has a higher likelihood of
spontaneous remission. ITP in adults, commonly presenting in women ages 20 to
40, is more likely to have an insidious or subacute presentation that can persist for
months to years, with uncommon spontaneous remission. The patient presents with
the clinical manifestations of thrombocytopenia (petechiae and mucosal bleeding)
without systemic toxicity, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly.
Laboratory values show normal white and red blood cell counts, and normal
peripheral blood smear except for thrombocytopenia. Laboratory testing is usu-
ally focused on a search for secondary causes of thrombocytopenia such as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and a
direct Coombs test to evaluate for autoimmune hemolytic anemia with ITP (Evans
syndrome). Bone marrow biopsy, although seldom recommended, reveals increased
megakaryocytes but otherwise normal findings. In patients older than 60 years,
bone marrow examination may be needed in order to exclude myelodysplastic
syndrome.
Adults with ITP and platelet count > 30,000/µL and no bleeding may be
observed without treatment. Those with lower platelet counts or bleeding can be
treated with oral glucocorticoids, such as prednisone. Platelet transfusions are usu-
ally unnecessary and should be reserved for rare life-threatening situations. The
survival of transfused platelets in ITP may be as short as a few minutes. Intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIg) is often used when platelet counts are less than 10,000/mm3
and can raise platelet counts rapidly. Anti-D is an anti-Rh(D) immune globulin for
patients who have an Rh+ blood type, but it may be ineffective in patients who
have had a splenectomy. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that tar-
gets autoantibody-producing lymphocytes and is a second-line therapy for patients
with chronic ITP.
Because the spleen removes the antibody-bound platelets, patients with chronic
ITP who do not respond to medical therapy may be candidates for splenectomy.
Patients being considered for splenectomy should receive immunizations for
encapsulated organisms such as Pneumococcus prior to surgery.
Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated disorder
caused by the formation of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 com-
plex, with the fall in platelet count usually occurring 5 to 10 days after heparin begins
or sooner if the patient had been sensitized by prior heparin use. HIT can cause
57_Toy-IM_Case56_p577-586.indd 580 24/08/20 3:57 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,608,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 581
serious consequences. HIT differs from other drug-induced causes of thrombo-
cytopenia in that it is not associated with bleeding, but rather with increased risk of
thrombosis. The four Ts are a useful mnemonic of the diagnostic criteria for HIT:
Thrombocytopenia (nadir rarely < 20,000/µL).

Timing of platelet count drop (usually 5–10 days).

New Thrombosis of skin necrosis.

Other causes of Thrombocytopenia are not likely.

Diagnosis depends on clinical suspicion and utilization of an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the HIT antibodies. Treatment includes
discontinuing heparin (one cannot switch from unfractionated heparin to low-
molecular-weight heparin because HIT antibodies will cross-react), and using a
nonheparin anticoagulant with a different mechanism of action such as argatroban,
fondaparinux, or bivalirudin to treat thrombosis.
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
Thrombocytopenia may also be caused by consumptive coagulopathy, the most
common of which is DIC. DIC usually is triggered by serious underlying condi-
tions, such as bacterial sepsis; malignancy, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia; or
obstetric catastrophes, such as abruptio placentae. Any of these disease processes
can produce pathologic levels of tissue factor, triggering uncontrolled thrombin
generation with systemic fibrin deposition in the microcirculation. This uncon-
trolled activation of coagulation results in consumption of platelets and clotting
factors, leading to secondary bleeding. Laboratory findings include thrombocyto-
penia, elevated PT and PTT (consumptive coagulopathy), decreased fibrinogen,
and elevated fibrin-split products and D-dimer (uncontrolled fibrin deposition).
Treatment should be directed toward correcting the underlying cause, as well as
replacement of platelets and coagulation factors if there is clinically significant
bleeding.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
TTP may be triggered by infection such as HIV or medications such as clopido-
grel, or it may be idiopathic. TTP is caused by autoantibody-mediated deficiency
of the ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin
type 1 motif, member 13) protease, which cleaves ultra-large von Willebrand fac-
tor (vWF) multimers on the endothelial surface. TTP is remembered by a pentad
of findings: (1) thrombocytopenia, (2) microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with
elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and schistocytosis in the peripheral
blood smear, (3) fever, (4) fluctuating central nervous system (CNS) deficits with
altered mental status, and (5) renal failure. Patients may be acutely ill, and differ-
entiation from DIC may be challenging except that the PT and PTT are typically
normal in TTP, but elevated in DIC. Plasma exchange is the standard treatment
and has reduced the mortality of this condition greatly. Table 56–1 compares DIC,
TTP, and ITP.

HUS presents very similarly to TTP, with acute renal failure, microangiopathic

limited to the kidney,” but the mechanism and treatment differ from TTP. HUS
occurs most often in children after a diarrheal illness, often with the hemorrhagic
strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Treatment is supportive, and plasma exchange
for HUS has not been shown to be useful.
von Willebrand Disease
Patients with vWD present clinically with impaired primary hemostasis (ie, pete-
chiae, easy bruising, mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia) with normal platelet counts
but impaired platelet function. vWD is the most common inherited bleeding

disorder. It may occur as often as 1 in 1000 individuals. It may be acquired, or it
may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder; however, it is often not recog-
nized because of relatively mild bleeding symptoms. von Willebrand factor is a
large, complex multimeric protein that has two major functions: It allows for plate-
let adhesion to endothelium at sites of vascular injury, and it is the carrier protein
for coagulation factor VIII, which stabilizes the molecule. vWD is a heterogeneous
group of disorders, but a common feature is deficiency in the amount or function of
vWF. Clinical features are those of primary hemostatic defects as discussed. Typi-
cal laboratory features are reduced levels of vWF, reduced vWF activity as mea-
sured by ristocetin cofactor assay, and reduced factor VIII activity. The platelet
count is usually normal, bleeding time is increased, and PTT may or may not be
prolonged. Treatment is desmopressin acetate, which causes release of vWF from
endothelial stores, or use of factor VIII concentrate, which contains a large amount
of vWF.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
56.1 A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with com-
plaints of excessive bleeding from her gums and petechiae. She is otherwise
healthy and takes no medications. She smokes half a pack of cigarettes daily
and occasionally drinks beer. Her temperature is 99.1 °F, BP is 110/81 mm Hg,
HR is 85 bpm, and respiratory rate (RR) is 12 breaths/min. On physical
examination, she has bleeding from her gums and petechiae on her bilat-
eral lower extremities. Her CBC shows a white blood cell (WBC) count of
87,000/mm3, a hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 22,000/mm3.
Which of the following is the most likely etiology of her low platelet count?
A. Acute leukemia
B. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia
C. Immune thrombocytopenia purpura
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus

56.2 A 50-year-old man has been treated for rheumatoid arthritis for many years.
He currently is taking corticosteroids for the disease. On examination, he has
stigmata of rheumatoid arthritis and some fullness on his left upper abdo-
men. His platelet count is slightly low at 105,000/mm3. His WBC count is
3100/mm3 with neutropenia, and hemoglobin level is 9 g/dL. Which of the
following is the most likely etiology of the thrombocytopenia?
A. Autoimmune destruction
B. Prior gold therapy
C. Splenic sequestration
D. Steroid induced
56.3 A 30-year-old woman with ITP comes to her outpatient hematology office
for a routine follow-up. She reports that despite taking maximum corticoste-
roid doses, she still has a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 and frequent bleeding
episodes. Which of the following should she receive before her splenectomy?
A. Bone marrow radiotherapy
B. Intravenous interferon therapy
C. Pneumococcal vaccine
D. Washed leukocyte transfusion
56.4 A 65-year-old man with a history of prosthetic aortic valve, hypertension, and
osteoarthritis is hospitalized for an elective knee replacement surgery. The
patient is a nonsmoker but drinks one or two glasses of wine on the week-
ends. His admission CBC shows a WBC count of 8000/mm3, hemoglobin
of 9.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 250,000/mm3. Medications started on
admission include acetaminophen, heparin prophylaxis, lisinopril, and panto-
prazole. The patient’s hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury
and postsurgery ileus. Five days after his knee surgery, laboratory tests are
significant for a platelet count of 62,000/mm3. Which of the following is the
most likely cause of the thrombocytopenia?
A. Acetaminophen
B. Alcohol intake
C. Heparin
D. Prosthetic heart valve
ANSWERS
56.1 A. The thrombocytopenia is seen with other hematologic abnormalities,
the most abnormal of which is a markedly elevated WBC count, suggesting
acute leukemia, which should be further worked up with a peripheral smear. The
patient is not on any known medication to cause thrombocytopenia (answer B).
ITP is often a diagnosis of exclusion in the setting of low platelets without addi-
tional hematologic abnormalities (answer C). The patient is not showing any
additional symptoms pointing to lupus, such as discoid or malar rashes, oral
ulcers, arthralgia, glomerulonephritis, and hypocomplementemia (answer D).
57_Toy-IM_Case56_p577-586.indd 584 24/08/20 3:57 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,612,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 585
56.2 C. This patient is likely suffering from Felty syndrome, characterized by
rheumatoid arthritis, neutropenia, and splenomegaly. Splenomegaly from
any etiology may cause sequestration of platelets, leading to thrombocytope-
nia. An acronym for Felty syndrome is SANTA: splenomegaly, anemia, neu-
tropenia, thrombocytopenia, and arthritis (rheumatoid). The other answer
choices (answer A, autoimmune destruction; answer B, prior gold therapy;
and answer D, steroid induced) can also cause thrombocytopenia, but splenic
sequestration is the most likely with this patient’s constellation of symptoms.
56.3 C. This patient should undergo splenectomy for refractory ITP. Thus, she
will be at risk for infections by encapsulated organisms such as Streptococ-
cus pneumoniae and will benefit from the pneumococcal vaccine. Usually, it
is given at least 2 weeks prior to splenectomy so that the spleen can help
in forming a better immune response. The other choices (answer A, bone
marrow radiotherapy; answer B, intravenous interferon therapy; and answer D,
washed leukocyte transfusion) would not provide the protective immune
response prior to splenectomy like the pneumococcal vaccine would.
56.4 C. The patient likely has HIT, which may be confirmed by assay for HIT
antibodies, including immunoglobulin G against platelet factor 4. The timing
after the exposure to heparin, the new platelet count, and the absence of a
possible alternative cause support the suspicion. Treatment consists of stop-
ping the heparin and starting a direct Xa inhibitor such as argatroban or
bivalirudin. Acetaminophen is more commonly associated with hepatotoxic-
ity than thrombocytopenia (answer A). Chronic alcohol intake (answer B)
may lead to thrombocytopenia through toxicity to the bone marrow, though
we would not likely see such an acute manifestation in the hospital setting.
Prosthetic heart valves (answer D) can lead to an increased risk of thrombosis
and embolization, especially in the setting of HIT.

A 55-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of 6 months of progressive
dull headaches and dizziness. She also endorses occasional blurred vision. She
has a history of hypertension treated with metoprolol and is otherwise healthy.
Her temperature is 99 °F, heart rate is 80 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure
is 110/70 mm Hg, and O saturation is 95%. On examination, the patient looks

flushed. Her mucous membranes are normal. Her heart and lung examinations
are unremarkable, but the liver is palpable 3 cm below the costal margin, and
dullness to percussion is noted at the lowest intercostal space in the left axillary
line. Though the patient did not notice this, the right leg is swollen compared to
the left one. The neurologic examination is nonfocal; no nystagmus is appreciated.
The fundoscopic examination shows bilateral plethora of the retinal veins. The
complete blood count reveals a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11,500/mm3,
hemoglobin level of 17 g/dL with a hematocrit of 51%, and platelet count of

ANSWERS TO CASE 57:
Polycythemia Vera
Summary: A 55-year-old woman presents with
Headaches, dizziness, blurred vision

Congested retinal veins, flushed face, and hepatosplenomegaly

Right leg swelling

No hypoxemia

Hemoglobin level of 17 g/dL with a hematocrit of 51%, all cell lines increased

Most likely diagnosis: Polycythemia vera (PV), with elevated hemoglobin and hema-
tocrit and clinical symptoms of hyperviscosity. Additionally, a deep vein thrombosis
(DVT) of the right leg is likely.
Next diagnostic step: Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level, JAK2 mutation testing,
peripheral smear to look for blasts, lower extremity duplex scan, and bone marrow
biopsy.
Next step in therapy: Low-dose aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy for PV. Due to
thrombus history, can consider hydroxyurea if symptoms not controlled by phle-
botomy. Therapeutic anticoagulation for DVT is also important.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the diagnostic criteria for PV. (EPA 1, 3)
2. Enumerate basic characteristics of myeloproliferative disorders. (EPA 1)
3. Understand alternative reasons for expansion of all lineages of blood cells.
(EPA 1, 2)
4. Outline the treatment options for PV. (EPA 4)
Considerations
This 55-year-old woman with 6 months of headache, dizziness, and blurry vision
is admitted with a DVT of the right leg. Physical examination consists of several
signs of hyperviscosity commonly seen in polycythemia, including congested reti-
nal veins, flushed face, hepatosplenomegaly, and right leg swelling. Together with an
elevated hemoglobin > 16 g/dL and hematocrit > 49% (criteria for women) with
normal oxygen saturation, this scenario points toward one of the myeloprolifera-
tive neoplasms (MPNs), namely, PV. Peripheral smear, EPO, and JAK2 mutation
should be obtained. A low EPO level would point toward a primary polycythemia
as opposed to a secondary polycythemia. JAK2 mutation is positive in nearly all PV
patients. A bone marrow biopsy would likely show hypercellularity with trilineage
growth. According to the World Health Organization guidelines, the diagnosis
58_Toy-IM_Case57_p587-596.indd 588 24/08/20 3:58 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,616,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 589
of PV requires meeting either all three major criteria (hemoglobin/hematocrit,
bone marrow, and JAK2 mutation) or two major criteria and one minor criteria
(low EPO). PV is a chronic condition and will require low-dose aspirin and thera-
peutic phlebotomy to keep hematocrit levels < 45% in men and < 42% in women.
A cytoreductive agent such as hydroxyurea can be considered if the patient contin-
ues to be symptomatic despite phlebotomy due to her thrombus.
APPROACH TO:
Polycythemia Vera
DEFINITIONS
ERYTHROPOIETIN: Hormone produced by the kidneys that is stimulated by
low oxygen levels to produce more RBCs in the bone marrow.
HYPERVISCOSITY SYNDROME: Constellation of symptoms arising from
increased blood cellularity, including headache, blurry vision, transient loss of
vision, chest pain, abdominal pain, and muscle pain.
MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASE: Group of hematologic disorders char-
acterized by overgrowth of bone marrow cell lines. Includes essential thrombo-
cythemia (ET), PV, and primary myelofibrosis (MF).
POLYCYTHEMIA VERA: Disorder of the bone marrow resulting in overproduc-
tion of red blood cells (RBCs).
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
MPNs are a collection of disorders that are caused by the overproliferation of stem
cells of the bone marrow, including ET, primary MF, and PV. All three may share
the JAK2 mutation, present in about 50% of cases of ET and MF, but in over 95%
of PV (Table 57–1). All have increased risk of leukemia. ET is defined by throm-
bocytosis, which is overproduction of platelets. MF is the replacement of bone
marrow by fibrosis. It has characteristic findings on peripheral smear, described
as a leukoerythroblastic picture, and commonly associated with teardrop-shaped
RBCs, nucleated erythrocytes, and precursors of granulocytes. PV is defined by

erythrocytosis, which is overproduction of RBCs, which we explore in more depth
in the following sections.
Etiology. PV, the most common of the myelodysplastic disorders, is seen
with an elevated hemoglobin and/or hematocrit; it can be initially differenti-
ated as relative polycythemia or absolute polycythemia. When plasma volume
is decreased secondary to diuretics or GI losses such as vomiting and diarrhea,
hemoglobin and hematocrit (which represent the concentration of RBCs in
blood) can be artificially elevated, commonly referred to as hemoconcentration
or relative polycythemia. In these cases, once a patient is appropriately fluid resus-
citated, hemoglobin and hematocrit are expected to normalize on a repeat CBC.
If there is no normalization of hemoglobin/hematocrit or if the clinical picture
is suggestive of PV, then absolute polycythemia, characterized by an increase in
RBC mass, is suspected.
Absolute polycythemia can then further be divided into two categories, primary
or secondary (Table 57–2). Primary polycythemia, caused most commonly by the
JAK2 mutation, results in increased RBC mass. Secondary polycythemia is driven
by elevated levels of EPO, which is secreted in response to low levels of oxygen, to
stimulate RBC production by the bone marrow. Most commonly, secondary poly-
cythemia stems from chronic hypoxia from a cardiac or pulmonary origin, namely,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),
obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), right-to-left cardiac shunt, high altitude,
or even heavy smoking. Performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids/
testosterone, growth hormone, and EPO have started to become a more common
cause of polycythemia. Additional causes include EPO-producing tumors, such
as hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, uterine leiomyoma, and adrenal
sources such as pheochromocytoma.
Diagnosis. If patient has elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit on complete blood
count in the context of normovolemia and normal O saturation along with signs
2
and symptoms of PV, then further evaluation with serum EPO level and/or JAK2
V617F mutation is warranted. If the EPO is elevated, then it is secondary polycy-
themia, most commonly associated with hypoxia. If the EPO is low to normal or if
signs/symptoms of PV are seen, then a positive JAK2 mutation is helpful in con-
firming its diagnosis. A bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity with trilineage
growth. Diagnostic criteria are shown in Table 57–3.

Clinical Presentation
Many times, patients are asymptomatic, and polycythemia is suspected from an
elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. Other times, patients present with a con-
stellation of symptoms, many of which may be nonspecific. Symptoms commonly
associated with PV include night sweats, weight loss, early satiety, gout, pruritis, and
erythromelalgia. Pruritis, described by many as itchiness, tingling, or burning after
a warm or hot shower, is often one of the chief complaints of a PV patient. Eryth-
romelalgia, which consists of a burning pain, redness, and increased temperature in
the hands and feet, is also a classic finding. Patients with PV are known to have an
increased risk of thrombosis, whether a DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke,
or arterial thrombus. Physical examination of a PV patient may include a plethora
of the retinal veins and face, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombosis, easy bleed-
ing or bruising, and tophi. If hyperviscosity develops, patients may have fatigue,
headache, blurry vision, stroke, and paresthesias.
Treatment
PV is a slowly progressive disease that can develop over decades, so treatment may
be indefinite. Overall, there are two main goals: (1) to reduce microvascular symp-
toms, such as pruritis, erythromelgia, and bleeding; and (2) to reduce thrombotic
events.
Low-dose aspirin is recommended for all PV patients unless contraindications
are present. Aspirin is particularly useful in reducing pruritis and erythromelal-
gia. Therapeutic phlebotomy, which decreases risk of thrombotic events by reduc-
ing hematocrit and expanding plasma volume, is the centerpiece of PV treatment.
Phlebotomy aims to keep hematocrit levels < 45% in men and < 42% in women.
High-risk PV patients are those who are > 60 years old and/or have a history
of thrombosis. In these patients, cytoreductive treatment might be useful. Further-
more, treatment may be indicated in low-risk patients with uncontrolled symptoms,
increasing platelet counts (especially over 1,000,000/µL) or persistently elevated
hematocrit despite phlebotomy. Hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor
that disrupts DNA repair to reduce the number of RBCs made by bone marrow,
is the first-line cytoreductive agent. Side effects include cytopenia, oral ulcers, and
diarrhea. In patients who fail hydroxyurea, ruxolitinib (Jakafi), a JAK inhibitor, is
58_Toy-IM_Case57_p587-596.indd 591 24/08/20 3:58 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,619,"592 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
becoming a mainstay in PV treatment. Other cytoreductive agents include inter-
feron alfa or busulfan. Interferon alfa is often used in patients < 40 years and in
pregnant patients. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is tied to many side effects, includ-
ing cytopenias, pulmonary fibrosis, skin discoloration, and/or leukemia.
Prognosis. All of the MPNs (PV, MF, and ET) can spontaneously progress to
acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Of the three, ET is the least
likely to progress, while primary MF is the most likely to transform. The 10-year
transformation rate is roughly 2% to 5% in ET, 5% to 8% in PV, and 8% to 20%
in MF. The median survival times also follow a similar pattern, with average sur-
vival being 20 years for ET, 14 years for PV, and 6 years for MF. In PV patients,
risk factors that increase risk of transformation to leukemia include age > 60,
history of thrombosis, and leukocytosis. In ET, increased age and anemia corre-
late with risk of fibrotic transformation. Once progression to leukemia and/or
blast phase has occurred, treatment includes induction chemotherapy followed
by allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

57.1 C. This male patient’s hemoglobin is > 16.5 g/dL and hematocrit is > 49%,
so he meets the criteria for polycythemia. Polycythemia could be primary or
secondary due to COPD or volume depletion. The best next step would be to
test the EPO levels, as a low level would point to PV and a high level would
point to a secondary polycythemia due to hypoxia or volume depletion, espe-
cially in the setting of his COPD history. JAK2 mutation is also another test
that is performed as part of the diagnostic approach prior to biopsy. Bone
marrow biopsy (answer A) and JAK2 evaluation can be obtained later if EPO
is low, but a high EPO makes PV unlikely. CT scan of the chest (answer B)
would be indicated if the patient had a pulmonary complaint such as chronic
cough, but it would not be high yield in this case. Phlebotomy (answer D) can
improve the hyperviscosity symptoms of polycythemia, but treatment should
be aimed toward finding and treating the underlying cause.
57.2 D. An elevated EPO level points toward a secondary polycythemia, likely due
to chronic hypoxia from a pulmonary or cardiac source, so JAK2 mutation
(answer B) and bone marrow biopsy (answer A) are not warranted at this
time. Due to the patient’s BMI of 40 kg/m2, shortness of breath, and insom-
nia, pulmonary function tests may reveal the underlying cause of his polycy-
themia. Phlebotomy (answer C) can improve the hyperviscosity symptoms of
polycythemia, but treatment should be aimed toward finding and treating the
underlying cause.
57.3 C. This female patient has hemoglobin > 16 g/dL, low EPO, JAK2 muta-
tion, and bone marrow findings suggestive of PV, so she meets not only all
three major criteria, but also the minor criteria. Though her platelets are over
450,000/mm3 and JAK2 mutation is positive, which can also be seen in ET,
she has classic bone marrow biopsy findings of PV, and ET (answer B) is con-
sidered a diagnosis of exclusion. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (answer A)
would typically lead to bone marrow infiltration of cancer cells and cause ane-
mia rather than polycythemia. Similarly, primary MF (answer D) is a disorder
where fibrous tissue forms in the bone marrow, leading to abnormally shaped
RBCs and anemia.
57.4 C. This patient is over the age of 60 and has a history of DVT, so he is con-
sidered a high-risk PV patient. Despite being on both aspirin and therapeutic
phlebotomy, the patient continues to have a hematocrit > 45%, so adding
a cytoreductive agent is recommended. Hydroxyurea is considered first-line
treatment. Busulfan (answer B) is another option, but it can cause pulmo-
nary fibrosis and would not be a good option in this patient with pulmonary
hypertension. Induction chemotherapy (answer D) would not be needed
unless we have confirmed progression to leukemia. Continuing the current
regimen (answer A) is not appropriate for this patient, who continues to have
an increased hematocrit.

A 25-year-old African American man is admitted to your service with the diagnosis
of a sickle cell pain episode. He was admitted to the hospital six times last year
with the same diagnosis, and he was last discharged 2 months ago. This time, he
presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal and bilateral
lower extremity pain, his usual sites of pain. When you examine him, you note his
temperature is 101 °F, blood pressure is 110/81 mm Hg, heart rate is 100 beats per
minute (bpm), and respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute. Lung examination
reveals bronchial breath sounds and egophony in the right lung base. His oxygen
saturation on 2 L/min nasal cannula is 92%. Besides the usual abdominal and
leg pain, he is now complaining of chest pain, which is worse on inspiration.
Although he has tenderness on palpation of his extremities, the remainder of his
examination is normal. His laboratory examinations reveal elevated white blood
cell and reticulocyte counts and a hemoglobin and hematocrit that are slightly
lower than baseline. Sickle and target cells are seen on the peripheral smear.

ANSWERS TO CASE 58:
Sickle Cell Crisis
Summary: A 25-year-old African American man presents with
A history of numerous pain crises

Fever, tachypnea, oxygen saturation of 92% on 2 L via nasal cannula, and slight

tachycardia
Abdominal pain, lower extremity pain, and chest pain that is worse on inspiration

Bronchial breath sounds and egophony in the right lung base

Leukocytosis, elevated reticulocyte count, and lower than baseline hemoglobin and

hematocrit
Sickle and target cells on the peripheral blood smear

Most likely diagnosis: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) since the patient has fever and
chest pain with respiratory symptoms.
Next step in management: Chest radiograph and empiric antibiotic therapy.
Potential complications: Respiratory failure, possible death.
Best treatment options: Aside from empiric antibiotic therapy, oxygen, pain control,
incentive spirometry, and blood transfusion (simple if mild symptoms or exchange
transfusion if severe).
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia and acute painful epi-
sodes. (EPA 12)
2. List the acute and chronic complications of sickle cell anemia. (EPA 10, 12)
3. Describe the treatment options available for the complications of sickle cell
anemia. (EPA 4)
Considerations
The patient in this case, a 25-year-old man with known sickle cell disease and a
history of numerous pain crises, is admitted with abdominal pain and bilateral leg
pain. He also has the acute onset of chest pain, cough, fever, and abnormal findings
on pulmonary auscultation. His oxygen saturation is only 92% on 2 L oxygen via
nasal cannula, which is concerning. Pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and ACS
should be considered as possible diagnoses. ACS is a constellation of symptoms
that includes chest pain and tachypnea. It can result from infection or from nonin-
fectious causes such as pulmonary infarction or fat embolism. It usually presents
with some combination of chest pain, fever, hypoxia, and a new pulmonary infiltrate
on chest radiography. Often, ACS and pneumonia cannot be initially distinguished.
59_Toy-IM_Case58_p597-604.indd 598 03/09/20 9:30 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,626,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 599
Therefore, it is prudent to treat these patients with antibiotics, obtain a Gram stain
and culture of the sputum, and admit them to the hospital. The treatment for ACS
is supportive and includes oxygen, intravenous fluid hydration, broad-spectrum
antibiotics, analgesia, and transfusion. With significant disease, an exchange trans-
fusion may be necessary. These patients should be carefully evaluated because sig-
nificant morbidity or mortality can result.
APPROACH TO:
Sickle Cell Anemia
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME: A condition found in individuals with sickle cell
disease; the condition is characterized by fever, tachycardia, chest pain, leukocytosis,
and pulmonary infiltrates.
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA: A congenital defect in hemoglobin formation such that
both genes code for hemoglobin S, leading to hemolysis and an abnormal shape of
the red blood cell. Affected individuals have numerous complications, including
pain crises.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Sickle cell anemia is the most common autosomal recessive disorder and the most
common cause of hemolytic anemia in African Americans. Approximately 8% of
African Americans carry the gene (ie, sickle cell trait), with 1 in 625 affected by the
disease.
The molecular structure of a normal hemoglobin molecule consists of two
alpha-globin chains and two beta-globin chains. Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal
recessive disorder resulting from a substitution of valine for glutamine in the sixth
amino acid position of the beta-globin chain. Individuals in whom only half of
their beta chains are affected are heterozygous, a state referred to as sickle cell trait.
When both beta chains are affected, the patient is homozygous and has sickle cell
anemia. In patients with sickle cell disease, the altered quaternary structure of the
hemoglobin molecule causes polymerization of the molecules under conditions of
deoxygenation. These rigid polymers distort the red blood cell into a sickle shape,
which is characteristic of the disease. Sickling is promoted by hypoxia, acidosis,
dehydration, or variations in body temperature.
Pain Crises. These are also called acute painful episodes and result from micro-
vascular occlusion of bones by sickled cells. The most common sites are the long
bones of the arms and legs, the vertebral column, and the sternum. Acute painful
episodes are precipitated by infection, hypoxia (ie, at high altitude), cold exposure,
dehydration, venous stasis, or acidosis. They usually last 2 to 7 days.
59_Toy-IM_Case58_p597-604.indd 599 03/09/20 9:30 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,627,"600 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
Infections. Patients with sickle cell disease are at greater risk for infections, espe-
cially with encapsulated bacterial organisms. Infarction of the spleen occurs dur-
ing early childhood secondary to microvascular obstruction by sickled red blood
cells. The spleen gradually regresses in size and by age 4 is no longer palpable. As
a consequence of infarction and fibrosis, the immunologic capacity of the spleen
is diminished. Patients with sickle cell disease are at greater risk for pneumonia,
sepsis, and meningitis by encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae
and Haemophilus influenzae. For the same reason, patients with sickle cell disease
are at greater risk for osteomyelitis with Salmonella spp.
Acute Chest Syndrome. This a vaso-occlusive crisis in the lungs and may be asso-
ciated with infection or pulmonary infarction. It is characterized by the presence of
the following signs and symptoms: new pulmonary infiltrate, chest pain, fever, and
respiratory symptoms such as tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. These episodes may
be precipitated by pneumonia causing sickling in the infected lung segments or, in
the absence of infection, intrapulmonary sickling can occur as a primary event. It
is virtually impossible to clinically distinguish whether or not infection is present;
thus, empiric antibiotic therapy is recommended.
Aplastic Crisis. This occurs secondary to viral suppression of red blood cell pre-
cursors, most often by parvovirus B19. It occurs because of the very short half-life
of sickled red blood cells and consequent need for brisk erythropoiesis. If red blood
cell production is inhibited, even for a short time, profound anemia may result. The
process is acute and usually reversible, with spontaneous recovery.
Other Complications. Other complications include hemorrhagic or ischemic
stroke as a result of thrombosis, pigmented gallstones, papillary necrosis of the
kidney, priapism, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.
Treatment
Patients admitted with sickle cell crises should have a complete blood cell count and
reticulocyte count upon admission. While this intervention does not change man-
agement substantially, it helps determine baseline values, risk stratify patients with
suspected concomitant infection, and rule out aplastic crisis. To protect against
encapsulated organisms, all patients with sickle cell disease should receive penicillin
prophylaxis and a vaccination against pneumococcus.
The mainstays of treatment of a pain crisis are hydration and pain control with
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and narcotics. It is important to also pro-
vide adequate oxygenation to reduce sickling. One must search diligently for any
underlying infection and start empirical treatment with antibiotics when infection
is suspected. ACS is treated with oxygen, analgesia, and antibiotics.
In general, blood transfusions may be required for aplastic crisis, for severe
hypoxia in ACS, or to decrease viscosity and cerebral thrombosis in patients with
stroke. Transfusion does not shorten the duration of a pain crisis. In severe disease,
especially when simple transfusions do not control the severity, exchange transfu-
sions have shown benefit.
59_Toy-IM_Case58_p597-604.indd 600 03/09/20 9:30 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,628,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 601
Hydroxyurea is often used to reduce the occurrence of painful crises or ACS.
This medication works by stimulating hemoglobin F production and thus decreas-
ing hemoglobin S concentration. The antineoplastic agent 5-deoxyazacytidine
(decitabine) may also elevate levels of hemoglobin F without excessive side effects.
Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil promote smooth muscle
relaxation in the lungs and can treat pulmonary hypertension. Endothelin receptor
agonists such as bosentan can improve pulmonary hypertension caused by sickle
cell disease. The mechanism of this agent is competitive binding to endothelin 1
(ET-1) receptors A and B in the pulmonary vascular endothelium. Because of the
numerous transfusions, sometimes iron chelators are needed to prevent iron over-
load (which may lead to heart or liver failure).
Emerging Concepts. Research is being concentrated on allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation, which can be curative. In children with severe disease,
myeloablative stem cell transplantation has been effective if there is a sufficiently
matched donor such as a sibling. There are side effects in approximately 10% of
patients. Adults usually have more complications. Gene therapy is only in its initial
stages of research but holds promise.

58.2 A 31-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and sickle cell anemia
presents to the emergency department with 2 days of cough, chest pain,
and difficulty breathing. His temperature is 100.7 °F, blood pressure is
112/65 mm Hg, heart rate is 117 bpm, respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min, and
pulse oximetry shows 94% on room air. White blood cell count is 13,000/mm3,
and hemoglobin is 9.9 g/dL (baseline of 10.1 g/dL). Chest x-ray reveals a
right lower lobe opacity. Blood and sputum cultures are collected. Which
of the following is the most appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy for this
patient?
A. Vancomycin
B. Ceftriaxone
C. Cefotaxime and azithromycin
D. Penicillin
58.3 A 6-year-old boy with a history of sickle cell anemia is brought to the emer-
gency department by his parents because of the boy’s 4 days of fatigue.
The patient is up to date on all his immunizations. His home medications
include penicillin and folic acid. His temperature is 99.3 °F, blood pressure
is 102/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 116 bpm, respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min,
and oxygen saturation shows 96% on room air. On physical examination, he
appears pale, but he has normal chest, respiratory, and abdominal examina-
tions. His white blood cell count is 7000/mm3, hemoglobin is 6.5 g/dL,
platelet count is 27,000/mm3, and reticulocyte count is 0.2%. Which of
the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Acute chest syndrome
B. Splenic sequestration
C. Aplastic anemia
D. Aplastic crisis
58.4 Which of the following is the most likely organism responsible in
Question 58.3?
A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Salmonella spp
C. Parvovirus B19
D. Staphylococcus aureus
ANSWERS
58.1 A. Hydroxyurea and decitabine may decrease the incidence of sickle cell cri-
ses by increasing levels of hemoglobin F. Penicillin prophylaxis (answer C)
and pneumococcal vaccine (answer D) protect against encapsulated organ-
isms. While folate supplementation (answer B) is needed for hematopoiesis,
it has no effect on the number of sickle cell crises.
59_Toy-IM_Case58_p597-604.indd 602 03/09/20 9:30 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,630,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 603
58.2 C. In patients with suspected ACS and/or pneumonia, the third-generation
cephalosporin cefotaxime, together with a macrolide such as azithromy-
cin, is optimal to provide coverage for the most common pathogens, such
as S. pneumoniae and Moraxella, respectively. Azithromycin or erythromycin
provides coverage for atypical organisms, such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia.
Although a cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone (answer B) is appropriate to
cover for common gram-positive and gram-negative etiologies of pneumonia,
this patient with likely autosplenectomy requires broader coverage. In very ill
patients or if a large and/or increasing infiltrate concerning for methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected, vancomycin (answer A)
can be added, but it is not routinely used as an initial stand-alone agent.
Answer D (penicillin) is insufficient coverage for pneumonia due to high
resistance.
58.3 D. In sickle cell patients, aplastic crisis can result from a temporary stop in
red blood cell production, characterized by a very low hemoglobin and reticu-
locyte count less than 1%. In contrast, aplastic anemia (answer C) is defined
as pancytopenia in patients without sickle cell disease. Splenic sequestration
(answer B) is associated with abdominal pain, increased reticulocytes, and
an acute drop in hemoglobin due to vaso-occlusion and pooling of red blood
cells in the spleen. In ACS (answer A), chest pain and respiratory symptoms
are commonly seen.
58.4 C. In children with sickle cell anemia, aplastic crisis is most commonly associ-
ated with parvovirus B19. Staphylococcus aureus (answer D) and Salmonella
(answer B) are the most common causes of osteomyelitis in sickle cell patients.
It is important to remember the association between sickle cell anemia and
Salmonella osteomyelitis. S. pneumoniae (answer A) is the most common
causative agent for pneumonia in sickle cell patients.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Treatment of an acute painful episode in sickle cell anemia includes
»
hydration, narcotic analgesia, adequate oxygenation, and the search for
an underlying infection.
Acute chest syndrome is characterized by chest pain, fever, new radio-
»
graphic pulmonary infiltrate, and respiratory symptoms; it can be caused
by pneumonia, vaso-occlusion, or pulmonary embolism.
Blood transfusion may be required for aplastic crisis, for severe hypox-
»
emia in ACS, or to decrease viscosity and cerebral thrombosis in patients
with stroke.
In sickle cell patients, parvovirus B19 is commonly associated with aplas-
»
tic crisis, and Salmonella is commonly associated with osteomyelitis.
Hydroxyurea and decitabine increase hemoglobin F production (decreas-
»
ing hemoglobin S concentration) and thus reduce the frequency of pain
crises and other complications.

A 57-year-old man was admitted to the hospital 2 days ago following a motor
vehicle accident. He suffered multiple contusions and a femur fracture that was
surgically repaired 24 hours ago. He also had a laceration on his forehead;
a computed tomography (CT) scan of his head on admission showed no
intracranial bleeding. His hospital course has been uncomplicated, and he
currently is taking morphine as needed for pain and subcutaneous enoxaparin
for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis. This evening he has been agitated
and combative and pulled out his intravenous (IV) line. He is cursing at the nurses
and is trying to get out of bed to leave the hospital. When you see him, he is
febrile with a temperature of 100.8 °F, heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood
pressure of 168/110 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen
saturations of 98% on room air. He is awake and fidgety, staring around the room
nervously. He is disoriented to place and time; he seems to be having auditory
hallucinations and is brushing off unseen objects from his arms. On examination,
his forehead wound is bandaged, his pupils are dilated but reactive, and he is
mildly diaphoretic. His lung sounds are clear to auscultation, his heart rhythm is


accident
Report from family members that the patient had no medical problems, dementia,

Fidgeting, disorientation, and suspected auditory and tactile hallucinations

Dilated pupils, mild diaphoresis, and tremors

Most likely diagnosis: Delirium as a result of an acute medical illness or possibly
alcohol withdrawal.
Next step: Look for serious or reversible underlying medical causes for the delirium.
If no other medical problems are identified, based on the patient’s daily alcohol use,
a possible diagnosis is alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize delirium in a hospitalized patient. (EPA 1)
2. List the most common causes of delirium. (EPA 2)
3. Understand the management of an agitated, delirious patient. (EPA 4)
4. Recognize the special considerations applicable to an older demented patient
with delirium. (EPA 1, 3)
5. Describe the stages, treatment, and complications of alcohol withdrawal
syndrome. (EPA 1, 4)
Considerations
This 57-year-old man had been in a normal physical and mental state prior to
hospitalization. He then developed an acute change in mental status, with fluc-
tuating consciousness and orientation, the hallmark of delirium. There are many
possible causes for his delirium: hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, acute electro-
lyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, occult infection, central nervous system hemor-
rhage or infection, or drug intoxication or withdrawal. These conditions require
60_Toy-IM_Case59_p605-614.indd 606 24/08/20 4:00 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,634,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 607
investigation before ascribing the symptoms to alcohol withdrawal because they are
potentially very serious or even fatal. In addition, further investigation to quantify
his alcohol intake is necessary. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are vital since this
patient has findings of significant autonomic instability based on the hyperthermia,
tachycardia, and high blood pressure. Mortality if untreated can approach 20%.
The use of a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam is a fundamental part of the treat-
ment regimen.
APPROACH TO:
Delirium and Alcohol Withdrawal
DEFINITIONS
DELIRIUM: An acute, fluctuating confusional state that is one of the most common
mental disorders encountered in hospitalized or otherwise medically ill patients.
DEMENTIA: Significant loss of intellectual abilities, such as memory capacity,
severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning, usually over a
long period of time.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO DELIRIUM
Pathophysiology
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
defines delirium as a clinical diagnosis. It has the following features:
Disturbance in attention (eg, reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift

attention) and awareness.
Change in cognition (eg, memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance,

perceptual disturbance) that is not better accounted for by a preexisting, estab-
lished, or evolving dementia.
The disturbance develops over a short period (usually hours to days) and tends

to fluctuate during the course of the day.
Evidence that the aforementioned features are caused by a medical condition,

medications, or intoxicants.
Delirium can be a manifestation of an underlying medical disorder. Some-
times, the underlying condition is apparent. At other times, especially in elderly
demented patients, delirium may be the first or the only sign of an acute illness, or
it may be a serious decompensation or complication of a stable medical condition.
Table 59–1 lists conditions that should be considered as causes of delirium. Of
these conditions, the most common are drug toxicity (especially anticholinergics,
sedatives, or narcotics in elderly patients), infection, electrolyte disturbances (most
commonly hyponatremia or hypoglycemia), and withdrawal from alcohol or other
sedatives.

Delirium in the Geriatric Population. Delirium in the geriatric population can be
the presenting manifestation of any acute illness, with an incidence of up to 10% on
admission and up to 30% during an acute hospitalization. Causes of delirium in the
elderly include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, gastroin-
testinal hemorrhage, traumatic injury, or virtually anything else that precipitates an
acute hospitalization. This is even more of a problem after major surgery; nearly
half of individuals (usually elderly) who suffer hip fractures develop delirium post-
operatively. Urinary retention and constipation may also precipitate delirium and
must be evaluated in all patients, especially given its high incidence in the elderly
population.
Persons at any stage of dementia may develop delirium during an acute illness or
injury or with additional pharmaceutical agent(s). Additionally, an acute delirium
may “unmask” an early underlying, undetected dementia. The confused and dis-
oriented geriatric patient cannot be dismissed as having one or the other, and the
history should concentrate on any changes in the behavioral status of the patient
since the acute event.
Clinical Presentation
Regardless of etiology, delirium produces a profound disturbance of brain func-
tion, and all etiologies are serious and potentially fatal illnesses. Delirium must
be approached as an acute medical emergency. A detailed history, aggressively pur-
sued, is mandatory, and because the responses from these patients cannot be relied
upon, information from family, friends, or other caregivers is essential. A thorough
physical examination with emphasis on neurologic status, clarity of speech, level
of awareness, attention span, facial droop, and weakness of an extremity must be
established because such changes must be carefully and frequently assessed. Basic
laboratory studies should focus on chemical abnormalities (glucose, creatinine,
bilirubin, serum sodium levels), drug intoxication, and evidence of hypoxia.
The two threatening and potentially easily reversible conditions—hypoxia and
hypoglycemia—should be immediately investigated and treated.
One of the earliest signs of a disturbance of consciousness is an inability to
focus or sustain attention, which may be evident as distractibility in conversation.

Case Files Internal Medicine,636,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 609
Usually, there also is disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle. In alcohol withdrawal,
signs of autonomic hyperactivity predominate, and patients may become hyper-
vigilant and agitated. As symptoms progress, patients may become lethargic or even
stuporous (arousable only to painful stimuli). Determining the time of the patient’s
last drink is key to diagnosing withdrawal delirium, as symptoms of delirium typi-
cally present 72 to 96 hours after the patient’s last alcoholic beverage.
To diagnose and monitor a delirious patient, it is important to utilize the Con-
fusion Assessment Method (or CAM) score. The CAM is a four-part screening
tool used to differentiate delirium and other causes of altered mental status and is
described as follows:
1. Acute onset and fluctuating course
2. Inattention
3. Disorganized thinking
4. Altered level of consciousness
The patient must have features 1 and 2 PLUS either 3 or 4 in order to meet criteria
for delirium. Questions concerning the patient’s mental state should be directed to
either the family or the nursing staff to assess for changes. Specifically, it is impor-
tant to ascertain from family members whether these impairments were chronic, as
in dementia, or developed acutely over hours to days and whether their symptoms
are fluctuating throughout the day. Not uncommonly, hospitalized patients appear
relatively lucid on morning rounds, especially if mental status is only superficially
assessed, but then the night staff reports severe confusion and agitation. Delirious
patients may hallucinate or have vague delusions of harm, but hallucinations are
not a mandatory feature of the condition. Delirium more commonly manifests with
hypoactive symptoms such as lethargy and inactivity and often goes unrecognized
by medical staff.
Treatment
The management of delirium needs first and foremost the identification and treat-
ment of the acute underlying illness. Adequate hydration, oxygenation, good nurs-
ing care, and around-the-clock careful supervision are always the initial measures.
Management of agitation and disruptive behavior is the most challenging aspect of
care of the delirious patient. Nonpharmacologic interventions should be attempted
first, including frequent reassurance and orientation from familiar persons or con-
stant supervision. A delirious patient is reoriented by sensory input, so it is impor-
tant that they be provided with glasses and/or hearing aids if required. Agitation
with psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) can be treated with a neu-
roleptic such as low-dose haloperidol. However, older patients are more likely to
experience extrapyramidal side effects, so newer atypical antipsychotics such as ris-
peridone may be used. Benzodiazepines have a rapid onset of action but may worsen
confusion and sedation. Physical restraint should be used as a last resort. Restraints
are often important and necessary in delirious patients to prevent removal of IV
lines, nasogastric tubes, and the like.
60_Toy-IM_Case59_p605-614.indd 609 24/08/20 4:00 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,637,"610 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
There is limited evidence that antipsychotics improve delirium, and recent stud-
ies have shown that use of antipsychotics does not shorten the amount of time a
patient is delirious when compared to placebo. Therefore, antipsychotics in deliri-
ous patients should be used cautiously and in the right circumstance because of
variable efficacy and potential side effects.
CLINICAL APPROACH TO ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL
Epidemiology
It is estimated that 5% to 10% of the population has alcoholism, and a fair pro-
portion will have withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Excessive alcohol use is
defined in men as 15 or more drinks per week and 5 or more drinks on a single
occasion. In women, this is reduced to 8 drinks or more per week and 4 or more
drinks on any single occasion. It is difficult to predict who specifically will suffer
from alcohol withdrawal, but excessive, daily drinkers are more likely to experience
symptoms. Many Americans are also habituated to benzodiazepines, and the with-
drawal syndrome is similar to alcohol withdrawal.
Pathophysiology
The withdrawal findings of alcohol or benzodiazepine cessation are complex and
can be explained largely due to the interaction of ethanol to the postsynaptic gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors, which are inhibitory neurons. Long-term
alcohol use leads to downregulation of the GABA-A receptors; the brain compen-
sates for this chronic loss of excitatory neurotransmission by increasing excitatory
neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Thus, with
the sudden cessation of alcohol, these excitatory neurotransmitters are unopposed,
leading to profound effects.
Clinical Presentation
Alcohol withdrawal manifests as a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from minor
tremulousness and insomnia to the most severe form, delirium tremens (DT),
characterized by delirium, tremor, and autonomic hyperactivity. The severity of
withdrawal can be assessed using a validated assessment tool, the Clinical Institute
Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) scale. However, the CIWA is labor intensive for
caregivers and especially tedious for nursing staff to conduct, so shorter assess-
ments can be used.
Risk factors for the development of DTs include a history of sustained drink-
ing, prior withdrawal symptoms, age older than 30, and a concurrent medi-
cal illness. Withdrawal can coexist with or mimic other conditions, such as
infection, intracranial bleeding, hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or
drug overdose. DT is a diagnosis of exclusion; other serious diagnoses must be
excluded before the patient’s mental status and autonomic signs are attributed
to withdrawal.
It is important to understand the temporal course of the spectrum of alcohol
withdrawal syndromes (Table 59–2). A key component of assessing alcohol with-
drawal is therefore determining the time of the patient’s last drink.

Table 59–2 • ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS
Stage Symptoms
Tremulousness Earliest symptom occurring within 6 h of abstinence, caused by CNS
and sympathetic hyperactivity, often referred to as the “shakes” or
“jitters,” and can occur even when patients still have a significant
blood alcohol level. In addition to the typical 6- to 8-Hz tremor, which
can be violent or subtle, insomnia, anxiety, gastrointestinal upset,
diaphoresis, and palpitations can occur. Tremor typically diminishes
over 48-72 h, but anxiety and easy startling can persist for 2 wk.
Withdrawal seizures Also called “rum fits.” Typically generalized tonic-clonic seizures, often
occurring in clusters of two to six episodes, and almost always within
6-48 h of abstinence. Seen in patients with a long history of chronic
alcoholism.
Alcoholic hallucinosis Typically develops within 12 h of abstinence and resolves within 48 h.
Hallucinations are most often visual (eg, bugs, pink elephants) but
can be auditory or tactile. When auditory, they are often maligning or
reproachful human voices. Despite the hallucinations, patients main-
tain a relatively intact sensorium.
Delirium tremens (DT) Most dramatic and serious form of alcohol withdrawal but occurs in
only 5% of patients with withdrawal symptoms. DT typically begins
within 48-72 h after the last drink and can last several days, often with
a resolution as abrupt as its onset. Characterized by hallucinations,
agitation, tremor, and sleeplessness, as well as signs of sympathetic
hyperactivity: dilated pupils, low-grade fever, tachycardia, hyperten-
sion, diaphoresis, and hyperventilation. Delirium tremens is a serious
condition with an in-hospital mortality of 5% to 10%, usually from
arrhythmias or infection, which is often unsuspected.
Treatment
In contrast to other causes of delirium, benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice in alco-
hol withdrawal. They can be given on a fixed schedule in high-risk patients (previous
history of DT or withdrawal seizures) to prevent withdrawal symptoms. If symptoms
have already developed, benzodiazepines can be given according to one of two strate-
gies. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide can be given in
high doses until withdrawal symptoms cease, and then the slow clearance of the drug
is allowed to prevent further withdrawal symptoms. However, these medications are
metabolized by the liver and should be used with caution in cirrhotic patients since
many alcoholics have some form of impaired liver function. Alternatively, benzodi-
azepines not metabolized in the liver, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam
may be used in these patients. These are shorter acting medications and must be given
as needed when the patient has symptoms. Both strategies are effective.
In either case, the key to successful management is initially aggressive upward
titration of dosage until the patient is heavily sedated but responsive, followed
by rapid downward titration as agitation decreases, usually over 48 to 72 hours.
Supportive measures are also important, such as adequate hydration, replacement
of electrolytes (eg, magnesium and phosphate), and early supplementation with
thiamine and other B vitamins in malnourished, chronic alcoholics to prevent the
development of Wernicke encephalopathy.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
59.1 A 35-year-old man is brought into the emergency department after a motor
vehicle collision. He is intoxicated due to alcohol. In assessing the effect of
alcohol on cognitive function, the emergency physician notes some similari-
ties to the effects of an other substance use. Which of the following agents
most closely resembles the action of alcohol in the brain?
A. Amphetamines
B. Marijuana
C. Cocaine
D. Benzodiazepine
E. Acetaminophen
59.2 A 56-year-old man is brought into the emergency center for being disoriented
and combative. He looks around the room with a wild look in his eyes and
does not follow directions. His wife states that his baseline is alert and ori-
ented with intact memory. He is diagnosed to have delirium. Compared with
dementia, which of the following is a characteristic of delirium?
A. A fluctuating level of consciousness
B. Slow onset
C. Can be due to deficiencies of thiamine or cyanocobalamin
D. Decreased memory ability
59.3 A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his friends
for “freaking out.” They state that he is usually in good health and has had no
head trauma or injuries but that he does drink a lot of alcohol each day. He is
noted to have marked tremors of his extremities and states that he is seeing
large scorpions skittering across the walls of the room and hearing the scor-
pions talking to him. Which of the following statements is the most accurate
description related to this patient?
A. Auditory hallucinations are unique to alcohol withdrawal and cannot be
caused by a brain tumor.
B. If the serum blood alcohol level is higher than the legal limits of intoxica-
tion, these symptoms cannot be alcohol withdrawal.
C. This patient should immediately receive glucose intravenously for pos-
sible hypoglycemia.
D. If the patient also has hypertension, fever, and tachycardia, he has a 5%
to 10% chance of mortality.

ANSWERS
59.1 D. Alcohol and benzodiazepines both interact with the GABA system; thus,
benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for treatment of acute alcohol with-
drawal. Answer C (cocaine) and answer A (amphetamines) both act as stimu-
lants in the brain, increasing levels of dopamine. Answer B (marijuana) acts on
the cannabinoid receptor in the brain, a typical G protein-coupled receptor.
59.2 A. Fluctuating levels of alertness and consciousness are typical of delirium.
Remember that delirium is usually acute in onset and fluctuates, whereas
dementia (the other answers) is slower and more gradual in onset and consis-
tent in alteration of cognition, such as memory issues.
59.3 D. This patient likely is suffering from alcohol withdrawal. DT with auto-
nomic instability and sympathetic overactivity is associated with a 5% to
10% mortality. Auditory hallucinations (answer A) can occur from a number
of illicit agents or even brain tumors. The fall in serum blood alcohol level
and not the absolute level may induce symptoms of withdrawal. Thus, even
if the patient’s serum alcohol level is elevated, he can still have withdrawal
(answer B). An individual who abuses alcohol should first be given thia-
mine before glucose (answer C) is administered to prevent acute Wernicke
encephalopathy.
CLINICAL PEARLS
Delirium is characterized by acute onset of impaired attention and cogni-
»
tion and fluctuating levels of consciousness, often with psychomotor and
autonomic hyperactivity.
Delirium requires urgent investigation to search for serious underlying
»
systemic or metabolic causes.
Frequent reassurance and orientation and constant observation are use-
»
ful in managing the agitated delirious patient. Low-dose haloperidol can
be used to control agitation or psychotic symptoms. Physical restraint is
used as a last resort.
Delirium tremens is the most severe and dramatic form of alcohol with-
»
drawal, with abrupt onset from 2 to 4 days after cessation of drinking and
sudden resolution several days later, and is associated with a mortality
rate of 5% to 10%.
Therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndromes includes benzodiazepines,
»
hydration, electrolyte replacement, and B vitamins to prevent Wernicke
encephalopathy.
The mechanism of alcohol withdrawal is due to excitatory neurotransmit-
»
ters due to sudden cessation of alcohol, which binds to GABA-A (inhibi-
tory) receptors.

A 21-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department by her college
roommate. The patient has been unconscious for at least 30 minutes. The patient’s
roommate is unaware of any health condition but states that the patient has
attended several college parties over the last weeks, and though she is uncertain
of this fact, she believes her roommate “has been doing drugs.” On examination,
the patient is somewhat pale. Her mucous membranes are dry. Her temperature
is 98 °F, heart rate is 80 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate is 8 breaths per
minute, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. The skin has no lesions suggestive
of intravenous injections. Her heart and lung examinations are unremarkable. The
abdominal examination reveals hypoactive bowel sounds, and the abdomen is
nontender. The patient barely opens her eyes upon painful stimulus. There is no
evident focal deficit. Pupils are miotic and sluggish. There is a normal gag reflex.
Routine laboratory tests are normal. The pregnancy test is negative. A urine drug
screen is positive for opiates.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical characteristics of opiate overdose. (EPA 1)
2. Outline the differential diagnosis of stupor and coma. (EPA 2)
3. Compare the effect of opiates over the central nervous system with that of
other drugs with potential for abuse. (EPA 1, 2)
4. Describe the sequence of interventions in the management of an emergent
intoxication. (EPA 4, 10)
Considerations
This young woman presents stuporous with the reassuring presence of a gag reflex,
which ensures that she is able to protect her airway. Her examination is nonspecific
and shows sluggish miotic pupils. Her blood pressure is low, and her respiratory
rate is slow. Her roommate says the patient “has been doing drugs,” and the drug
screen is positive for opiates. While the differential diagnosis of stupor is broad,
many signs point toward an acute opiate intoxication. Sadly, this patient’s presenta-
tion is all too common, since opioid use disorder has become an epidemic and is
associated with a large number of deaths. The most important immediate interven-
tion is respiratory support, since respiratory depression is the most common cause
of death. Her oxygen saturation should be assessed, and ventilation should be pro-
vided using bag/mask for hypoxemia and/or a respiratory rate below 12/minute.
Nalaxone, a competitive mu opioid receptor antagonist should be administered
parenterally.

APPROACH TO:
Opiate Overdose
DEFINITIONS
COMA: A state in which an individual is unarousable and unresponsive.
DRUG ADDICTION: Neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a recurring
desire to continue taking the drug despite harmful consequences, or engagement in
illegal or criminal activities in order to obtain access to such a drug.
OPIATE: A drug containing or derived from opium. It can be natural, semisyn-
thetic, or synthetic.
STUPOR: A state between alertness and comatose, with an alert patient being
arousable.
SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE: Physiopharmacologic term that implies that the
body has adapted to a substance, so its absence leads to some form of withdrawal
syndrome.
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER: According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), it is defined as a problematic pattern of use
of a substance leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, manifested
within a 12-month period. The manifestations can include the following: strong
urges; preoccupation with use; a reduction in social, occupational, or recreational
activities; and more. Depending on the number of the diagnostic criteria met, a
severity of mild, moderate, or severe is assigned.
CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Substance use disorder is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the
United States and throughout the world. Opioids continue to rise as a cause of
drug overdoses, and an increasing amount of prescription opioids are involved. Due
to this phenomenon, chronic opioid dependence to acute opioid toxicity as in this
case are all part of the spectrum of pathology that can result from opioid use.
Opioids have central nervous system depressant and analgesic effects and can
create a feeling of euphoria as well. The receptors for opioids are located in the cen-
tral and peripheral nervous systems and include mu, kappa, and delta. Stimulation
of mu receptors in the central nervous system results in responses such as respiratory
depression, analgesia, euphoria, and miosis. Cough suppression and constipation
can result from activation of peripheral mu-opioid receptors located in the smooth
muscle of the bronchi and intestines, respectively.
Diagnosis. The history, physical examination, and routine and toxicologic labora-
tory evaluations are used to establish and confirm acute opioid toxicity. When
61_Toy-IM_Case60_p615-626.indd 617 24/08/20 4:01 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,645,"618 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
approaching a stuporous patient, it is important to be methodical: Think first
of the conditions for which an early diagnosis modifies the outcome. Such is the
case for hypoglycemia, meningoencephalitis (needing a lumbar puncture), and
some types of cerebrovascular accidents. As a rule of thumb, any other diag-
nosis allows clinicians to select tests appropriate to historical and exam-based
features.
As soon as the patient presents, particularly if altered from an unknown drug,
a rapid screening examination should be completed to determine if any imme-
diate steps are needed to stabilize the patient. Vital signs should be measured,
mental status should be assessed, and pupil size should be measured. Skin mois-
ture should be assessed, and a thorough skin examination should be conducted
to identify any stigmata of drug use (eg, needle tracks or presence of skin-based
drug delivery such as a fentanyl patch). Pulse oximetry, continuous cardiac moni-
toring, and an electrocardiogram should be obtained. Intravenous access with
large-bore catheters and a finger-stick blood glucose measurement should be
obtained as well.
If unable to obtain a history from the patient, any information about known
current medications or possible ingestion or substance consumed from a bystander
or someone familiar with the patient would be helpful.
Differential Diagnosis. Table 60–1 offers a nonexhaustive differential diagnosis
of stupor. A plethora of drugs that can result in stupor or coma need to be con-
sidered. Some of them cause distinct physical examination findings supporting
alternative diagnoses. Antihistamines, antipsychotics, barbiturates, beta-adrenergic
antagonists, carbon monoxide, cholinergics, clonidine, cyclic antidepressants, etha-
nol, toxic alcohols such as methanol or ethylene glycol, organophosphates and sym-
patholytics represent some examples of drugs that can impair the brain function.
Laboratory Tests. A finger-stick serum glucose concentration should be quickly
obtained since hypoglycemia, which can be rapidly detected and corrected, may
otherwise obfuscate the differential of opioid toxicity. All patients should have
a urinalysis and serum chemistries evaluated, including electrolytes, blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose. Serum creatine kinase, liver function
tests, lipase, ionized calcium, magnesium, arterial blood gas, serum osmolality, and
serum lactate can also be tested. Urine pregnancy testing should always be obtained
in any woman of childbearing age.
Some drug levels can be measured; such is the case of acetaminophen, alcohol,
aspirin, and lithium. Salicylate concentration need not be obtained in the absence
of elevated respiratory rate or high anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Other Tests. Other studies should be based on the known history and tailored
to each patient’s presentation. This includes thyroid function tests, blood cultures,
a chest x-ray, and brain imaging studies. An electrocardiogram may provide useful
information, such as the duration of the QRS and QTc intervals, which could be
modified by loperamide or methadone, respectively.
Special Considerations. A urine toxicologic screen is not always necessary but
may be helpful. Acute opioid toxicity is a clinical diagnosis; importantly, if the clini-
cal characteristics are present, the management of a patient with an opioid toxicity
would not change if a urine opioid screen is negative. A positive test demonstrates

Clinical Presentation
The physical examination findings of opioid toxicity can include the following
changes in vital signs: bradypnea, bradycardia, hypotension, and hypothermia.
A common finding in opioid toxicity is respiratory depression. Hypoactive bowel
sounds may be noted, and the patient may present comatose or with seizure. While
miosis is characteristic, its absence or even the presence of mydriasis does not
61_Toy-IM_Case60_p615-626.indd 619 24/08/20 4:01 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,647,"620 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
preclude opiate toxicity but could instead suggest co-ingestion of other drugs. The
mental status of a patient presenting with opioid toxicity can range from euphoric
to comatose.
Persistent immobility in the patient with stupor can lead to compressed
fascia-bound muscle groups, resulting in compartment syndrome and rhabdo-
myolysis; the myoglobin released from injured muscle can precipitate in the renal
tubules, leading to acute kidney injury.
Treatment
The initial management is focused on addressing the patient’s airway, breathing, and
circulation and providing support to these systems if needed. Pulse oximetry may
measure oxygenation but cannot determine the presence of hypercapnia. An arte-
rial blood gas measurement may be needed.
The most significant therapeutic decision to make is the administration of
naloxone; the success of this intervention also confirms the diagnosis of opioid
toxicity. Naloxone is a short-acting opioid antagonist. It can be dosed starting at
0.04 mg intravenously; for patients presenting with apnea or cardiopulmonary
arrest, at least 2 mg are usually necessary. Bradypneic patients should be venti-
lated by a bag valve mask attached to supplemental oxygen before and after nal-
oxone administration to reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The dose should be increased every few minutes until the respiratory rate is
12 breaths/min or greater. The goal is to achieve adequate ventilation and not
necessarily to normalize consciousness.
Naloxone can also be given intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or even intrana-
sally if intravenous access cannot be obtained, but with these routes absorption is
delayed and titration is difficult. As long as symptoms of opioid withdrawal are not
present, more naloxone can be given, but after administration of 5 to 10 mg with-
out a clinical response, the diagnosis should be reconsidered.
If opioid withdrawal occurs, the patient should be managed symptomatically
and not by administration of more opioids. One important consideration in opioid
toxicity as opposed to other drug toxicities is that activated charcoal and gastric
emptying are never an appropriate management decision and are only considered if
there is a strong suspicion for co-ingestion of other drugs.
Prevention. Most patients with acute opioid toxicity can be cared for in the
emergency department without hospital admission, assuming there is no other
medical issue of concern. Psychiatric evaluation can be done once respirations
and mental status are normal. For patients with features consistent with addic-
tion, rehabilitation is indicated. Teaching opioid users, family members, and
friends how to recognize opioid toxicity and prescribing them naloxone reduces
mortality.
Detoxification or supervised opioid withdrawal is the first step in treatment and
reduces withdrawal symptoms. Medication is typically needed to prevent relapse.
Naltrexone, which is an opioid antagonist, is a possible treatment, but it should be
started after opioid withdrawal is thoroughly completed. Other treatments, such
as methadone and buprenorphine, which are opioid agonists, can be started while
a patient is still using opioids.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
60.1 A 59-year-old man with past medical history significant for long-standing hip
and knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis is seen in clinic. The pain mildly
improves with heat and relaxation, but he also has several acute exacerbations
of pain daily that cause his “legs to freeze” and prevent him from working.
These episodes do not respond to nonpharmacologic therapy, such as acu-
puncture. He has tried multiple nonopioid analgesic drugs but stopped them
due to minimal improvement in pain or gastrointestinal side effects. Opioid
therapy is considered. Which of the following is also recommended before
prescribing opioid therapy to this patient?
A. Psychiatry referral
B. Current Opioid Misuse Measure survey
C. Naloxone prescription and education
D. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapies
E. Opioid-related harm risk factor assessment

60.3 A 37-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department by
emergency medical services. The patient has been unconscious for at
least 30 minutes and was found in a park. On examination, the patient
is pale. Her mucous membranes are dry. Her temperature is 98 °F, heart
rate 100 bpm, respiratory rate 10 breaths/min, and blood pressure
95/65 mm Hg. The skin has no lesions suggestive of intravenous injec-
tions. Her heart and lung examinations are unremarkable. The abdom-
inal examination reveals hypoactive bowel sounds, and the abdomen is
nontender. The patient barely opens her eyes upon painful stimulus.
There is no evident focal deficit. Pupils are normal. There is a normal gag
reflex. Routine laboratory tests are normal. The pregnancy test is nega-
tive. A urine drug screening is negative for opiates. What is the next best
step in management?
A. Evaluate serum chemistries to evaluate anion gap
B. Assess serum osmolarity
C. Draw an ethanol level
D. Evaluate carboxyhemoglobin
E. Perform gastric lavage
F. Administer naloxone
60.4 A 34-year-old man with past medical history significant for the use of mul-
tiple illicit drugs is evaluated in the emergency department for impaired
mentation. On arrival, he was minimally responsive with miotic and sluggish
pupils. His respiration rate on arrival was 8 breaths/min, but 10 minutes after
administration of three doses of intravenous naloxone, his respiration rate
is 16 breaths/min, and he is alert and oriented and completely conversant.
His vital signs are normal now, and his pulse oximetry demonstrates 99%
on room air. He says that he would like to go home today, and he wants to
completely stay away from drugs and be rid of this addiction. Which of the
following is the best step in management?
A. Refer to psychiatry
B. Admit to the hospital
C. Discharge and refer to an opioid detoxification program
D. Administer naloxone
ANSWERS
60.1 E. Opioid therapy is reasonable in a patient with pain unresponsive to
nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies. A treatment plan may include
other therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or physical therapy. If
the risks outweigh the benefits and yet opiates are indicated, providers can
offer a prescription for naloxone (answer C). Factors that increase risk for opi-
oid overdose are history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, higher
opioid dosages, and concomitant use of benzodiazepines. The presence of
61_Toy-IM_Case60_p615-626.indd 622 24/08/20 4:01 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,650,"SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 623
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obstructive sleep apnea
should also encourage naloxone prescription. However, this would only be
done after risk factor assessment. If the patient does not have an apparent
mental health diagnosis, psychiatry referral (answer A) is not necessary
before prescribing opioid therapy. Nonsteroidal therapies (answer D) have
been ineffective in the past, and prescribing them again does not address the
patient’s concerns. The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (answer B) is a self-
report survey of current drug-related behavior meant for patients currently
receiving long-term opioid therapy with possible misuse.
60.2 C. In the treatment of opioid overdose, naloxone therapy should be titrated
to respiratory rate and not normalized mentation. This patient’s respiratory
rate has recovered to greater than 12 breaths/min, but his mentation has not
fully recovered. The antidote effects of naloxone will usually wear off before
the opioid effects are eliminated. Thus, observation and repeated dosing
depending on the clinical status may be necessary. The most crucial aspect to
be wary of is respiratory depression. Discharging the patient now (answer A)
would be inappropriate. Serial escalating doses of naloxone (answer B) may
be necessary in some patients, and those patients may require a continuous
naloxone infusion. However, it is not indicated in this patient at this time.
Since breathing has normalized and the patient is protecting his airway, there
is no indication for intubation (answer D). Gastric lavage (answer E) is never
indicated in these patients unless there is a strong suspicion for co-ingestion
of a substance for which such intervention has been proven useful.
60.3 F. When comparing the effects of opiates with that of other drugs with poten-
tial for abuse, it is helpful to begin the approach with whether the patient is
in a state of physiologic excitation versus depression. There is more evidence
here of physiologic depression. Physiologic depression can manifest as central
nervous system depression, hypotension, bradycardia, bradypnea, and hypo-
thermia; these symptoms are associated with opiates, ethanol cholinergics,
sympatholytics, and toxic alcohols. Mixed effects can occur in many patients,
and considerations of physical examination findings outside the central ner-
vous system and vital signs can be helpful to elicit the diagnosis. They include
body odors, pupillary findings, skin findings, and neuromuscular aberrations.
Normal pupillary findings do not rule out opiate toxicity. Urine toxicology
screen may also be negative, particularly with synthetic opioids, and does not
rule out the diagnosis. The most specific finding in this patient for possible
opiate toxicity is the respiratory rate depression, and the quickest therapeu-
tic decision that can be made here is administration of naloxone. Obtaining
serum chemistries (answer A) or osmolarity (answer B) would be appropriate
only after naloxone administration. Gastric lavage (answer E) is not indicated
unless evaluation suggests another toxic ingestion and naloxone is ineffective.
The ethanol level (answer C) may be checked but neither rules in nor excludes
ethanol-related toxicity. Evaluation of carboxyhemoglobin (answer D) may
be warranted due to unknown history, but it should be measured only after
naloxone administration.

60.4 C. Opioid use disorder is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in
the United States and throughout the world. The patient’s recognition of the
drug burden on his life and desire to get over this drug use disorder should
not be taken lightly. Detoxification or supervised opioid withdrawal is the
first step in treatment and reduces withdrawal symptoms. Most patients
with opioid toxicity can be cared for in the emergency department without
hospital admission (answer B), assuming there is no other medical issue of
sufficient concern. Psychiatric evaluation (answer A) may be needed if the
patient’s history and presentation are consistent with indication for referral,
but there is no such indicator in this patient. Teaching opioid users how to
recognize opioid toxicity and giving them naloxone reduces mortality and
may be beneficial to give to the patient upon discharge, but naloxone adminis-
tration (answer D) does not need to be repeated now. Medication is typically
needed to prevent relapse.
CLINICAL PEARLS
The typical signs of acute opioid intoxication are central nervous system
»
depression, bradypnea (especially < 12 breaths/minute), bradycardia,
hypotension, decreased bowel sounds, and miotic pupils.
A normal pupil examination does NOT exclude opioid toxicity.
»
In stuporous patients, a finger-stick serum glucose concentration should
»
be quickly obtained, as hypoglycemia can be rapidly detected and
corrected.
Electrocardiographic findings may provide useful information; the dura-
»
tion of the QRS and QTc intervals should be carefully noted.
The initial management when opioid toxicity is suspected is addressing
»
the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation.
If opioid toxicity is suspected, treat with the short-acting opioid antago-
»
nist naloxone, preferably intravenously.
Normal mentation is not the goal, but rather a respiratory rate of
»
12 breaths/min or greater. Titrate the naloxone dose up and frequently
until this goal is achieved.
Opioid withdrawal symptoms should be managed symptomatically and
»
not with more opioids.
Activated charcoal and gastric emptying are not appropriate in acute
»
opioid intoxication unless there is a strong suspicion for co-ingestion of
other drugs for which these measures are indicated.

ANSWERS
R1. D. This patient suffered a hip fracture with minimal trauma. He has secondary
hyperparathyroidism with low calcium, high phosphate, and high PTH levels.
ESRD patients can be at risk for bone fractures due to a decrease in bone
mineral density, described as osteitis fibrosa cystica. Individuals with ESRD
are unable to activate vitamin D in the kidney, thus creating hypovitaminosis
D, which impairs the absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract. Decreased serum calcium then impairs regulation of parathyroid hor-
mone (PTH) production, causing a secondary hyperparathyroidism (high
PTH). Furthermore, decreased kidney function impairs the excretion of
phosphate, causing serum phosphate levels to become elevated, sometimes
requiring treatment with phosphate binders. Thus, this patient should have
decreased serum calcium, increased serum phosphate, and increased serum
PTH. It is called secondary hyperparathyroidism since the low calcium
drives the body to increase PTH levels. Answer A (increased Ca, decreased
Po , increased PTH) is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism where
3
increased PTH (usually due to a parathyroid adenoma) causes an increase in
calcium release from the bone, as well as increased excretion of phosphate
by the kidney. The patient in this question instead has secondary hyper-
parathyroidism in response to the low calcium level. Answer B (increased Ca,
increased Po , decreased PTH) is consistent with hypervitaminosis D, which
3
is caused by excessive vitamin supplementation or granulomatous disease
such as sarcoidosis. In sarcoidosis, immune cells in the granulomas outside
of the kidney synthesize the active form of vitamin D. Excess vitamin D will
stimulate intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate; additionally, the
62_Toy-IM_Sec-III-RQ_p627-640.indd 634 02/09/20 7:36 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,662,"SECTION III: REVIEW QUESTIONS 635
elevated calcium will inhibit PTH secretion. Thus, the driving force is the
hypercalcemia which causes the low PTH level. Hip fractures secondary to
osteoporosis are unlikely to demonstrate abnormal laboratory values, where
those that are secondary to Paget disease will show an isolated elevated
alkaline phosphatase (see Case 35 [Osteoporosis, Cushing Syndrome] and
Case 50 [Hypercalcemia/Multiple Myeloma]).
R2. E. This man has both platelet and clotting factor dysfunction inherited in an
autosomal dominant fashion, most consistent with vWD. This condition is
caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which plays a role
in primary (platelet-driven) and secondary (clotting factors) hemostasis.
In primary hemostasis, vWF is released by damaged endothelium and
binds to the platelet glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) receptor. If vWF is decreased
or absent, platelets are unable to bind to the damaged endothelium, which
causes manifestations of platelet dysfunction (increased bleeding time) such
as petechiae, epistaxis, and increased bruising without affecting the num-
ber of platelets. Also, vWF is responsible for protecting clotting factor VIII
from rapid breakdown in the blood; therefore, a deficiency of vWF can cause
a deficiency of factor VIII, elevating the aPTT without affecting the PT.
Answer A (aspirin overdose) causes platelet dysfunction without decreasing
the number of platelets by irreversibly inhibiting thromboxane A2 (TXA2),
making platelet aggregation ineffective in primary hemostasis; however,
aspirin does not affect secondary hemostasis laboratory values (PT/PTT).
Answer B (Bernard-Soulier syndrome) is also an isolated dysfunction of
platelets, whereby there is a deficiency of the GpIb receptor, preventing
platelet adhesion to the vWF expressed by the damaged epithelium. This
syndrome produces the same effect as vWD in primary hemostasis; however,
there is no dysfunction of clotting factors and no elevation in PT or PTT.
Answer C (hemophilia A) is an X-linked inherited disorder characterized by
a deficiency in factor VIII that causes dysfunction in secondary hemostasis
alone, which is clinically manifested by an elevated PTT, normal bleeding
time and PT, and increased deep bleeding, such as hemarthrosis (bleeding
into joints). Answer D (vitamin K deficiency) would manifest as an elevated
PT, mildly increased PTT, and no effect on bleeding time or platelet num-
ber from the inability to activate clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X through
gamma-carboxylation (see Case 56 [Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura/
Abnormal Bleeding]).
R3. C. This patient needs an antifungal treatment such as fluconazole for Can-
dida esophagitis. When the CD4+ counts fall below 100 cells/mm3, patients
infected with HIV are at risk for developing esophagitis. Esophagitis pres-
ents with primary complaints of odynophagia (painful swallowing), dys-
phagia, and a substernal burning chest pain. White plaques that are easily
removed with a tongue blade are consistent with oral thrush caused by
the opportunistic fungus Candida, which can result in esophagitis when it
extends beyond the oral cavity to the proximal esophagus. C. esophagitis is
the most likely diagnosis in patients presenting with oral thrush. Endoscopy

and biopsy are not necessary before initiating treatment with oral fluconazole.
However, if patients show no improvement and have no signs of oral thrush,
endoscopy with biopsy is warranted. Answer A (acyclovir) would be appro-
priate treatment for herpes simplex virus (HSV) esophagitis, which would
present with multiple small vesicles and round/ovoid ulcers on endoscopy.
Cells on biopsy would contain eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. Answer B
(azithromycin) is appropriate for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
prophylaxis when the CD4 count is < 100 cells/mm3. Answer D (ganciclovir)
is appropriate for treating cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis, which
demonstrates large linear ulcerations likely in the distal esophagus. Biopsy
would be positive for intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. Answer E
(sulfadiazine-pyrimethamine) is appropriate treatment for toxoplasmosis,
which usually presents as multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain when
the CD4 count is < 100 cells/mm3 (see Case 46 [HIV/AIDS and Pneumo-
cystis Pneumonia]).
R4. B. This patient is most likely suffering from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,
which is best treated with IV antibiotics. This patient is likely in end-stage
liver failure due to known alcoholic cirrhosis. One of the many complications
of cirrhosis is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, an infection of the ascitic
fluid most often caused by flora of the GI tract, such as Escherichia coli or Kleb-
siella. It is associated with a high mortality rate (20%-30%) and is likely to
recur. Clinical presentation is subtle, and there should be a high index of sus-
picion in order to initiate treatment as soon as possible. Common symptoms
include fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and altered mental status in a patient
with known cirrhosis. Diagnosis is confirmed with a diagnostic paracentesis
evaluating fluid for WBCs, in particular PMN cells, Gram stain, and culture.
There will be a serum ascites-albumin gradient (SAAG) ≥ 1.1 g/dL, the fluid
will have a PMN count ≥ 250 cells/μL, and there will be a positive culture.
However, empiric treatment should be initiated with a third-generation
cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) while awaiting culture results
since the most common cause is gram-negative organisms. Answer A (oral
lactulose) would be the appropriate treatment for hepatic encephalopathy to
prevent reabsorption of the toxic metabolite ammonia. Clinical presentation
would include an altered mental status; however, this diagnosis is less likely
given the patient’s fever and diffuse abdominal pain. Answer C (empiric IV
octreotide) would be appropriate during the treatment of bleeding esopha-
geal varices, which usually present in a patient with liver failure and massive
hematemesis. Octreotide acts as a vasoconstrictor to the splanchnic vessels,
helping to reduce portal pressure and therefore decreasing variceal bleeding.
Answers D (liver transplant) and E (protein-restricted diet) would not be
appropriate initial treatments for this patient presenting with an active infec-
tion (see Case 24 [Liver Cirrhosis]).
R5. D. This patient has developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and
empiric antibiotics should include antipseudomonal coverage. VAP is a pneu-

more than 2 days. It should be suspected when there is an acute change in
the intubated patient, including a new fever, decrease in oxygen saturation,
and new purulent secretions. A chest x-ray should be obtained, and VAP
should be suspected if there is an acute change in a previously clear chest
x-ray (showing new infiltrates). A lower respiratory tract endotracheal sam-
ple should be sampled and cultured. Pending cultures, empiric antibiotics
optimally would include gram-positive coverage, as well as anti-Pseudomonas
and gram-negative coverage; additionally, coverage for MRSA should be
considered in settings of higher prevalence. Once bacteriological sensitivities
come back, the antibiotic regimen can be narrowed to the specific organism.
Answer A (C. pneumoniae) is a cause of community-acquired atypical pneu-
monia where the patient presents with an insidious onset of various symp-
toms, such as headache and fatigue with dry cough and fever—“walking
pneumonia.” Chest x-ray will most likely demonstrate interstitial infil-
trates. Answer B (H. influenzae) is the organism associated with pneumo-
nias found in patients with other comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, or alcoholism. Clinical presentation
will be similar to patients with community-acquired pneumonia, such as
fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Answer C (L. pneumophila) is the
causal organism associated with pneumonia named “Legionnaires’ dis-
ease,” usually in patients who are heavy smokers and have been exposed to a
contaminated water source. A urine antigen test can confirm this diagnosis.
Answer E (MRSA) would be incorrect because in a hospitalized patient,
MRSA would be a more likely cause of VAP (see Case 19 [Community-
Acquired Pneumonia] and Case 42 [Neutropenic Fever, Vascular Catheter
Infection]).
R6. A. This patient’s symptoms are consistent with carcinoid syndrome caused by
a neuroendocrine serotonin-secreting tumor. Carcinoid tumors are neuroen-
docrine tumors, usually arising in the appendix, that secrete serotonin. The
serotonin excretion is usually asymptomatic when the tumor arises in the
GI tract due to liver detoxification of the serotonin into inactive metabo-
lites. However, when there are metastases to the liver, serotonin excretion
becomes symptomatic. Clinical manifestations often include profuse watery
diarrhea, episodes of flushing and bronchospasm, and valvular lesions affect-
ing the right side of the heart, such as tricuspid regurgitation. This patient’s
2/6 holosystolic murmur is consistent with this complication. Niacin defi-
ciency is a potential complication due to increased conversion of tryptophan
to serotonin, manifesting as dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. The next
best test would be 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels, which
would be elevated in someone suffering from carcinoid syndrome. Answer B
(24-hour urine metanephrines) is a screening test for pheochromocytoma,
which would present as a patient suffering from persistently high blood
pressure and episodes of severe HTN and headache. Answer C (endoscopy
with colonoscopy) would be the next appropriate test to diagnose various GI
disorders such as Crohn disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that pres-
ents with chronic diarrhea (usually not grossly bloody but may test occult
62_Toy-IM_Sec-III-RQ_p627-640.indd 637 02/09/20 7:36 PM"

blood positive), weight loss, possible anemia from diseased ileum, and other
manifestations, such as uveitis, arthritis, and skin lesions. Answer D (metha-
choline challenge) is the appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate for asthma,
which is characterized by bronchospasm and wheezing. Notably, asthma is
usually diagnosed as a child and presents without long-standing diarrhea.
Answer E (secretin injection test) is the diagnostic test of choice to evalu-
ate for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), a gastrinoma that is a pancre-
atic islet cell tumor. Clinical manifestations include side effects related to
excessive gastrin production, such as gastric ulcers, abdominal pain, and
diarrhea. Secretin usually suppresses gastrin; however, patients with ZES
would demonstrate high gastrin levels after the secretin injection test (see
Case 47 [Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Antidi-
uretic Hormone]).
R7. D. This patient most likely has a nephrotic syndrome due to membranous
nephropathy secondary to hepatitis B infection. Nephrotic syndrome is defined
as an abnormal glomerular permeability and may be due to many causes. It
results in urine protein excretion > 3.5 g/24 h, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlip-
idemia, edema, a hypercoagulable state, and an increased risk for infection.
Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of primary nephrotic
syndrome in Caucasian adults, and the most common secondary cause is
hepatitis B. Histologic examination will demonstrate diffuse capillary and
glomerular basement membrane thickening. Answer A (diabetic nephropathy)
presents as a nephrotic syndrome from nonenzymatic glycosylation of the
basement membrane in a patient with long-standing uncontrolled diabetes.
Histologic examination of diabetic nephropathy will demonstrate mesan-
gial expansion and eosinophilic nodular glomerulosclerosis, also known as
Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions. There is nothing in this patient’s history to sug-
gest diabetes. Answer B (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) is a nephrotic
syndrome associated with African Americans and Hispanics and can be sec-
ondary to conditions such as HIV and sickle cell disease. Answer C (IgA
nephropathy) usually presents as a nephritic syndrome characterized by
HTN, azotemia, oliguria, and hematuria following an upper respiratory
infection or gastroenteritis. Answer E (minimal change disease) is the most
common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children; it is caused by T-cell dys-
function (see Case 24 [Liver Cirrhosis] and Case 29 [Nephrotic Syndrome
and Diabetic Nephropathy]).
R8. B. This patient is suffering a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) secondary to a
hypercoagulable state. Those with nephrotic syndrome are in a hypercoagu-
lable state primarily due to a loss of antithrombin III in the urine. Other
fibrinolytic proteins, such as proteins S and C (answers C and D), are also con-
tributory but are not thought to be the major factor. Renal vein thrombosis
is often seen in this setting (see Case 29 [Nephrotic Syndrome and Diabetic
Nephropathy]).
R9. C. This patient is most likely suffering from Dressler syndrome, which is an
autoimmune reaction to the pericardium usually occurring 2 to 10 weeks
62_Toy-IM_Sec-III-RQ_p627-640.indd 638 02/09/20 7:36 PM"

after an MI, associated with fibrinous pericarditis. Appropriate treatment
is NSAIDs and high-dose aspirin. The typical clinical presentation is fever,
malaise, and pericarditis (chest pain with a friction rub that improves when
leaning forward) occurring weeks to months after an MI. Answers A (nitro-
glycerin and metoprolol) and B (morphine and supplemental oxygen) are
appropriate treatments during the acute phase of an MI; only nitroglycerin
and metoprolol should be initiated as maintenance therapy after the MI.
Answers D (IV heparin and clopidogrel) are appropriate treatments for
anticoagulation during another MI or for a left ventricular mural thrombus.
Answers E (IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone) is appropriate treatment for
bacterial endocarditis, which would most likely present with fever and a new
murmur (see Case 3 [Myocardial Infarction, Acute]).
R10. D. This patient developed acute kidney injury after a 30-minute tonic-clonic
seizure. A urine dipstick that is positive for blood and a urinalysis with few
microscopic RBCs is highly suggestive of myoglobinuria. The seizure activity
likely led to muscle injury. Rhabdomyolysis is caused by excessive, rapid mus-
cle breakdown as a result of crush injury, trauma, seizures (in this patient),
prolonged immobility, or snakebites. As muscle breaks down, myoglobin is
released into the bloodstream and filtered by the kidneys. Myoglobin is toxic
to the renal tubules (precipitates) and can cause an acute kidney injury via
acute tubular necrosis. Typically, the creatine kinase (CK) levels are mark-
edly elevated. Given that the injury to the kidney is intrinsic and impairs
renal function, the BUN:Cr ratio will usually be < 20, and the kidney will
be unable to conserve sodium and concentrate the urine. Answer A (vascular
inflammation) is more consistent with the pathophysiology of nephritic syn-
drome, which is characterized by HTN, azotemia, oliguria, and hematuria.
Answer B (outflow obstruction) is more consistent with a postrenal kidney
injury secondary to obstruction of the ureter, bladder, or urethra. Diagnosis
would be made by physical examination, ultrasound imaging, and catheter-
ization. Renal failure is present when kidneys are obstructed bilaterally, but
when the obstruction is removed (provided this is not a chronic condition),
renal function is restored. Answer C (poor renal perfusion) is the pathophys-
iology behind prerenal failure usually secondary to decreased cardiac output,
hypotension, or volume loss/sequestration. Laboratory values will include a
BUN:Cr of > 20 and preserved function of the kidney to concentrate urine
and reabsorb sodium (see Case 30 [Acute Kidney Injury]).
R11. B. This patient is suffering from cor pulmonale, right-sided heart failure sec-
ondary to a COPD. On chest x-ray, the lungs would be clear, and there would
be evidence of hyperinflation with depression of the diaphragm. Clinical
signs suggestive of cor pulmonale in this patient include jugular venous
distention, hepatojugular reflex, and no crackles on lung auscultation. Dif-
ferentiating between left and right heart failure can be difficult, especially
when left ventricular failure can often lead to right ventricular dysfunction.
However, given this patient’s long-standing smoking history and no evidence
of left ventricular dysfunction, such as orthopnea or pulmonary edema, the
62_Toy-IM_Sec-III-RQ_p627-640.indd 639 02/09/20 7:36 PM"
Case Files Internal Medicine,667,"640 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE
cause of his heart failure is most likely due to right ventricular dysfunction
(as evidenced by the parasternal heave) secondary to long-standing pulmo-
nary disease. The pulmonary artery would also be prominent from increased
pulmonary pressures over time. Answer A (bilateral pulmonary infiltrates)
is more consistent with pulmonary edema and the transduction of fluid into
the lungs from increased pulmonary venous pressure via left ventricular
dysfunction. These findings would be seen with left heart failure. Answer C
(unilateral lobar consolidation) is consistent with a lobar pneumonia, which
presents as a patient with fever, cough, shortness of breath with or with-
out secretions, and crackles on auscultation of the lobe with consolidation.
Answer D (widened mediastinum) is consistent with an aortic dissection,
which usually presents as a patient with tearing chest pain radiating to the
back who has long-standing hypertension or a collagen-vascular disease such
as Marfan syndrome. Answer E (multiple pulmonary nodules) would be
consistent with pulmonary cancer. Affected individuals usually have hemop-
tysis, weight loss, dyspnea, and night sweats (see Case 4 [Heart Failure due
to Critical Aortic Stenosis]).
R12. C. This woman most likely has Hashimoto thyroiditis based on the symptoms
and positive anti-TPO antibodies. She is at an increased risk for lymphoma of
the thyroid. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition common in
middle-aged women characterized by antibodies toward components of the
thyroid gland. Initially, patients may present with a transient period of hyper-
thyroidism due to release of thyroid hormone from follicle rupture. Eventu-
ally, patients will present with symptoms of hypothyroidism such as weight
gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, dry cool skin, and thin, brittle
hair. Hashimoto thyroiditis is diagnosed clinically by physical examination
of a diffusely enlarged thyroid with a possibly rubbery texture, symptoms of
hypothyroidism, and an elevated TSH with positive anti-TPO antibodies.
Histologic confirmation can be established with thyroid fine-needle aspira-
tion biopsy. These patients are at a 40- to 80-fold increased risk for primary
lymphoma of the thyroid gland, thought to be due to somatic hypermuta-
tion. Other neoplasms of the thyroid are associated with different disease
processes. Answer A (anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid) is associated with
an older patient population, usually with history of long-standing follicular
or papillary carcinoma, and is highly malignant. Answer B (follicular carci-
noma of the thyroid) may be associated with iodine deficiency and is more
malignant than papillary cancer. Biopsy would be the only way to differenti-
ate follicular carcinoma from a benign adenoma, by assessing whether there
is extension into surrounding vasculature or through the capsule. Answer D
(medullary carcinoma of the thyroid) is associated with multiple endocrine
neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and MEN2B syndromes arising from the para-
follicular cells (C cells), which produce calcitonin. Answer E (papillary car-
cinoma of the thyroid) is associated with a history of radiation of the head
and neck during childhood, and histologic examination would demonstrate
empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing (see Case 53 [Thyrotoxicosis/
Graves Disease]).
